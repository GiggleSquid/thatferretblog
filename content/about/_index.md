This blog provides information, sources, overviews, and personal opinions about ferret welfare, husbandry, and diet (specifically raw feeding). As well as personal stories and updates on our own ferrets.

Owned by two ferret enthusiasts. Our special interest in mustelids has led us to heavily research ferrets and form our own opinions based on our findings (and personal experiences).

We aim to educate and inspire ferret owners with a blog that provides a little bit of everything ferret-related!

A little bit about us:
- We are currently studying a Level 3 Qualification in Practical Animal Care & Management, which also involves research on pine martens and their reintroduction in various conservation projects throughout the UK.
- We are members of a Ferret Welfare Rescue & Society (CFWRS). We participate in various shows and events, raising money for the rescue, writing newsletters, and providing fostering space as needed.
- Jack (the main raw food enthusiast) hopes to go into studying animal nutrition with a keen emphasis on mustelids.

A little bit about our ferrets:
- We currently have 8 wonderful ferrets. All of them were either adopted or are permanent fosters from Cambridgeshire Ferret Welfare & Rescue Society.
- Our ferrets are Boots, Toots, Loot, Newt, Fruit, Flute, Snoot, & Foot.
- With hopes in the future to be able to foster more ferrets for CFWRS.

For further research and ferret-related things, please visit my [linktree](https://linktr.ee/thatbunny); there you will find links to sites such as the Holistic Ferret Forum, the website for CFWRS and our ferrets' personal Instagram!
