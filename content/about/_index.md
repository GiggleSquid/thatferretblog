Hi, my names Bunny (from the UK). I have always had a passion for animals, animal care & welfare. My partner and I have rescued an array of animals including rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, mice, bearded dragons, snakes, dogs and ferrets. However, I have always had a special interest in ferrets. We currently own 2 rescues - Boots & Toots, who were adopted from CFWRS (a ferret rescue).

Our special interest in mustelids has lead us to heavily research ferrets and form our own opinions based on our findings (and personal experiences). This blog will be a little bit of everything.

We are also studying a level 3 qualification in practical animal care & managment which involves research around pine martens and their reintroduction in various conservation projects througout the UK.

For further research and ferret related things, please visit [my linktree](https://linktr.ee/thatbunny), there you will find links to sites such as the 'Hollistic Ferret Forum' and our ferrets personal instagram!
