Someone asked, 'What are the pros and cons of owning ferrets? Would they make good starter pets?'.

Here's a little list I put together.

### Pros:
- Highly social and playful animals that will keep you laughing for hours! They're interesting & exciting.
- Build strong bonds with owners and make good companionship.
- Relatively easy & enjoyable to care for once you have researched and are in a routine compared to other exotic animals (Y'all don't come for me. This is not to say they are easy pets - but they are easier/more enjoyable than some other exotic animals - based on my experiences).
- They can be cuddly and affectionate (some are not).
- Very intelligent and can be trained, making them versatile (litter box trained, harness & lead trained, etc.).
- Help with routine and stability.
- Can benefit your MH & reduce anxiety/stress.

### Cons:
- Expensive. Very expensive. This includes start-up costs, general upkeep, replenishing stock (toys, litter, bedding, food, enrichment), and vet care.
- Vet care (as a separate con) because not only is it expensive but you'll have to source an exotic specialist vet. Depending on where you're from (or where the ferrets are from) you'll also have to account for spaying/neutering, microchipping, injections etc.
- Health & Research. Also, depending on where you are, there's not a lot of research on domesticated ferrets. They're also prone to a lot of illnesses with age or genetics.
- Specialist diet. They're obligate carnivores, so you need to do a lot of food research. The best diet for them is raw; depending on how you choose to do your raw, it can be costly, time-consuming (for preparation), and quite tedious sometimes.
- Space & Free roam. They need a large cage — saying this, they are not caged animals and will need multiple hours of free roam a day. This takes up a lot of your time, and you also need to spend additional time ferret-proofing everywhere they roam.
- Biting. Ferrets can and will bite; it's how they communicate and initiate play. They will have to be bite-trained, but you will still get the occasional nip — meaning they won't be a great option if you're overly sensitive to roughhousing.
- General maintenance. Grooming, nail clips, and general things you will have to do (could be considered a con for some people).

I wouldn't recommend ferrets as a starter pet at all. They're highly complex exotic animals. Out of all the animals I've rescued and personally owned, I'd say they're in the top 3 of being high maintenance. But if you're willing to put in the time, effort, and dedication to owning them, they will make absolutely wonderful pets and bring you so much joy!
