## Why ferrets need other ferrets

It's a common misconception that lone ferrets can 'be fine' on their own, exceptional circumstances notwithstanding. All ferrets should be able to have other ferret friends. It's important to keep ferrets in at least pairs or more.

Some people would argue that 3+ ferrets is the ideal number. This is because if one ferret is ill or passes away, the remaining 2 ferrets will still have each other.

Unlike their wild counterparts, polecats, who are not sociable â€” but tolerable of the same species. Ferrets are the opposite, highly sociable, playful, and loving creatures who thrive best with their own species. Keeping 1 ferret can lead to depression or that ferret not meeting their basic needs in play, enrichment, or welfare.

One of the Five basic welfare needs for animals under the [Animal Welfare Act 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/45/contents) states that the animals should 'be housed with, or apart from other animals (if applicable)' and as needed.
The fact it is highlighted within animal welfare legislation means it is generally understood that social animals require companions to best thrive in their environments and meet their essential welfare needs. This does not mean that ferrets MUST have friends, but more so that they need them to thrive (over survive).

The Animal Welfare Act 2006 is UK legislation, more info can be [found here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-welfare).

If you're in a different country or are interested in the laws governing animal welfare law across the globe, you can find relevant Animal Welfare information and legislation from the [Global Animal Law Association](https://www.globalanimallaw.org/database/index.html).

## The benefits of having multiple ferrets

As well as fulfilling a basic welfare need, there are many benefits to owning more than 1 ferret. These may include:

- Allowing ferrets to exhibit more natural behaviours. Living in pairs or more allows the ferrets to exhibit more natural behaviours such as scent marking, chasing, playing with other ferrets, sleeping together, etc.
- Enrichment. The most enriching thing for a ferret is another ferret!
- A boost in ferret happiness. Many lone ferret owners report an increase in their ferrets' general happiness after adopting a second ferret friend.
- Socialisation and social stimulation. Ferrets will be able to gain more social stimulation and a better sense of socialisation by interacting with others.
- Extra ferret play. Ferrets can play with other ferrets differently from how a human and ferret may interact.
- Allows ferrets to exhibit natural grooming behaviours. Ferrets often lick and groom each other, which they can't do if they're alone.
- General Companionship. People are not ferrets and cannot offer the same companionship that another ferret may offer. General companionship may include playing, sleeping, grooming, and other previously mentioned behaviours and methods of communication.
- Reduced stress and boredom. Ferret friends can offer an abundance of interaction, stimulation, and companionship to other ferrets. This will decrease the likelihood of stress and boredom in ferrets.
- Decreased likelihood of depression.

We have personally found that (except for veterinary expenses) owning 2 ferrets is not much different to owning a single ferret. In fact, many ferret owners will frequently say that it is almost less work having multiple ferrets. Cleaning (unless you have a rather large [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret#Etymology)) does not differ much, nor does the food, stimulation or basic needs.

The main differences between owning 2 ferrets rather than 1 are interaction, free-roaming, and veterinary expenses.

Having a single ferret means you will need to spend more time engaging, playing, and being with the ferret. Whereas having 2 or more, the ferrets will play with others, entertain and get social stimulation from each other. This does not mean they will not need any free roam. But it does mean that they will be less up your bum and constantly pestering you for play and uppies.

## Addressing lone ferrets

Ferrets are often kept as single ferrets for many reasons. These reasons could include:

- Misinformation. Some ferret owners believe that ferrets are fine by themselves and are misinformed.
- Ferrets are adopted/bought singly.
- Affordability. Some ferret owners argue that they can't afford a second ferret.
- Ferret death. If a ferret friend has recently passed away, sometimes the ferret will be kept as a lone ferret for a short period to allow them to grieve.
- Old age. Similar to the above. Some ferrets are kept alone due to old age after a friend's death. Some ferrets may also be alone if they were adopted out at an old age, have old-age-related injuries, illness' or concerns or the owners are not planning to adopt any ferrets and continue their ferret ownership journey. This can be completely valid, as sometimes, rehoming ferrets in their old age can cause them more stress than being alone.
- Aggression. Some ferrets, particularly those with extreme cases of aggression, those who are older and have been kept alone/unsocialised, or ones with aggressive tendencies will be kept as lone ferrets.
- Illness/Sickness. Some ferrets who have specific illnesses will be kept quarantined or as lone ferrets for their own/other ferrets' safety.

In some instances (like some of the ones mentioned above), it is perfectly acceptable to keep a lone ferret. However, if you have a perfectly young and healthy ferret, then it is always best to get them a friend. Not doing so is denying them basic welfare needs.

### "But I've always had lone ferrets"
Both animal care and our understanding of welfare needs constantly change. Although you may have always had lone ferrets and do not see an issue with it, it is now commonly known that ferrets do better in social groups. Depriving them of this is denying them a basic welfare necessity.

### "My ferret is alone and is just fine"
Although your ferret may appear fine and not display any outward signs of depression, many owners report that even their supposedly happy and fulfilled single ferrets have thrived more when introduced to a friend. Just because your ferret outwardly appears happy does not mean they do not need a friend.

### "I always spend time with my ferret and can take the place of a friend"
Even if you spend all your time, 24/7, with a ferret. You are not a ferret. Humans cannot provide the same amount or level of interaction, socialisation, comfort, etc. As another ferret could. We also cannot outwardly communicate with the ferrets. So, getting your ferret a friend will still be beneficial for them. This is also relevant to other species.

### "I cannot afford more than 1 ferret"
As above, except for veterinary fees. Keeping 2 ferrets is not much more expensive than keeping 1. If you cannot support the essentials and meet basic welfare needs for your ferret, then you may want to consider alternative options.
