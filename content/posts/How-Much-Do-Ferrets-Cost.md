I get asked a lot 'What's the start-up cost for a ferret?' and 'How much do your ferrets cost?' etc.

Firstly, you will be looking at the cost of owning two or more ferrets, as they typically need to live in at least pairs.

The costs for ferrets can be split up into 4 categories:
1. [Initial ferret supplies](#initial-ferret-supplies). This will cover all the basics needed before you bring your ferrets home.
2. [The ferrets themselves](#the-ferrets-themselves). This will be how much the ferrets are to purchase or adopt.
3. [Ongoing costs](#ongoing-costs). This will cover all maintenance and replenishing costs such as food, litter, and other supplies.
4. [Veterinary care costs](#veterinary-care-costs).

### Initial Ferret Supplies
You'll want to cover the essentials before you consider bringing the ferrets home. This would require a start-up cost and include things such as a cage for your ferrets, suitable bedding, litter trays, litter (or puppy pads), bowls (bottles are not recommended), a carrier, toys/enrichment, and I highly recommend setting up a ferret emergency kit. The cost for these things varies depending on what items you buy and where you get the items from. But expect a few hundred to be spent.

I have written a basic ferret supplies checklist, which can be found [here](/posts/initial-ferret-supplies-checklist/).<br>
I have also written a post about my favourite supplies and where to source them, which is *COMIN SOON* — please note this is specific to the UK. Similar items may be available in the US and other countries.

### The Ferrets Themselves
Another cost to consider would be the initial cost of purchasing or adopting the ferrets. This would depend on where you are from and where you get the ferrets. Adopting or rescuing a pair of ferrets may cost less and require a small donation or adoption fee. Whereas ferrets brought from a breeder or pet shop may cost a lot more.

Typically, adopting a pair of ferrets can range anywhere from £20-£50 per ferret. If buying from an established private breeder, it can range from £50-100 per ferret. In the UK ferrets are not sold in pet shops but as an example: within the US, if buying a ferret from a pet shop you're looking at around $499 per ferret (that's about £395). So as you can tell, the initial cost for the ferrets is substantially different.

### Ongoing Costs
The ongoing cost for ferrets is pretty minimal. But (you've guessed it) — it varies! You will want to replenish food supplies, litter (or puppy pads) and enrichment.

Food costs would depend on what diet you are feeding your ferrets (kibble, raw, 80/10/10, whole prey etc.), and on how much you are feeding your ferrets/how quickly the food is likely to run out and needs to be restocked. Additionally, you may also factor in the cost of appropriate food-related equipment, such as storage containers or meat preparation equipment.

Litter or puppy pads will need to be bought as/when you run out of them. It will depend on which one you use, how often you clean the litter area, and what size bags of litter or pads you buy. I buy around 5 bags of litter per month, the bags are 10l each, and that covers my ferrets' litter boxes, which I clean once every 2 days or as/when it is needed. I have only brought 2 packs (x50 in a pack) of puppy pads which have lasted over 5 months with leftovers, this is because I only put puppy pads in the corners of the ferrets' room and throw them away if an accident should occur.

Lastly, toys and enrichment. This cost would depend on what you get and where from, if items need to be replaced and your spending habits (I know I spend way too much on spoiling my babies). Toys and enrichment can often be DIY-ed, but you would still need to take into account the cost of materials. Enrichment, for ferrets specifically, could be as easy as a paper bag or tub full of uncooked rice. As long as your toys and enrichment activities are rotated to provide endless entertainment for your ferrets and prevent boredom — they are happy with anything! Toys should be thrown out and replaced if broken, worn down or damaged.

### Veterinary Care Costs
Ferrets are considered exotic animals and their veterinary fees are rather substantial. They are probably the most hefty cost to consider in the long term. If you live in the US, ferrets will usually be Marshall ferrets, which means they are already vaccinated and spayed/neutered. But in the UK (unless you adopt) ferrets will need to be spayed/neutered and vaccinated which can be quite costly. It is also a good idea to get your ferrets microchipped and checked over by the vet at least once a year for a general check-up and to rule out any health concerns. Spay/neuter costs are around £100-£200 per ferret, vaccinations can range from £50-75 and checkups £50-100.

The real cost occurs as your ferret ages. Ferrets are prone to several illnesses, many of which need ongoing care provided by a vet. This can easily cost £100s-£1000s in vet bills per ferret! This excludes any accidents or emergency vet trips!

It is important that your ferret is insured or that you are putting money aside for vet care in case it's needed.

### Personal Cost Breakdown
My personal start-up cost for my pair of ferrets was around £700ish. This included their cage, toys/enrichment, bedding, initial food, grooming supplies, treats, and the ferrets. We adopted our ferrets from a rescue so they were already vaccinated, neutered, and spayed, meaning there were no additional costs. We spend around £25 a month on litter replenishment, £45 on raw food supplies, and £20ish a month on the odd toys. This list breakdown doesn't include random, small, purchases like additional toys or blankets. It doesn't include random big purchases like a cat wheel or stand mixer with food processor attachments (for raw food prep). And lastly, it doesn't include pet insurance, which we have yet to get.

To conclude, ferrets are very costly. But are they worth it? In my opinion, yes, absolutely! But you may want to check out the [Potential Pros & Cons of Owning Ferrets](/posts/potential-pros--cons-of-owning-ferrets/) and decide for yourself!
