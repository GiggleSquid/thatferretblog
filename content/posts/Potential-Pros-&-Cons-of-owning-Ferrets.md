Someone asked 'what are the pros and cons to owning ferrets? Would they make good starter pets?'.

Here's a little list I put together.

Pros:
- Highly social and playful animals that will keep you laughing for hours! They're interesting & exciting.
- Build strong bonds with owners and make good companionship.
- Relatively easy & enjoyable to care for once you have researched and are in a routine compared to other exotic animals (Yall don't come for me. This is not to say they are easy pets - but they are easier/more enjoyable then some other exotic animals - based on my experiences).
- They can be cuddly and affectionate (some are not).
- Very intelligent and can be trained making them versitile (litter box trained, harness & lead trained etc).
- Help with routine and stability.
- Can benefit your MH & reduce anxiety/stress.

Cons:
- Expensive. Very expensive. This includes start up costs, general upkeep, replenishing stock (toys, litter, bedding, food, enrichment) and vet care.
- Vet care (as a seperate con) because not only is it expensive but you'll have to source an exotic specialist vet. Depending on where you're from (or where the ferrets are from) you'll also have to account for spay/neutering, microchipping, Injections etc.
- Health & Research. Also depending where you are there's not alot of research on domesticated ferrets. They're also prone to alot of illness' with age or genetics.
- Specialist diet. They're obligate carnivores so you need to do alot of research on food. The best diet for them is raw, depending on how you choose to do your raw it can be costly, time consuming (for preperation) and quiet tedious at times.
- Space & Free roam. They need a large cage - saying this they are not caged animals and will need multiple hours of free roam a day. This takes up alot of your time and you also need to spend additional time ferret proofing everywhere they roam.
- Biting. Ferrets can and will bite - its how they communicate and innitiate play. They will have to be bite trained but you will still get the occasional nip. Meaning they won't be a great option if you're overally sensitive to rough-housing.
- General matienence. Grooming, nail clips & general things you will have to do (could be considered a con for some people).

I wouldn't reccomend ferrets as a starter pet at all. They're highly complex exotic animals. Out of all the ones I've rescued and personally owned, I'd say they're in the top 3 of being high matience. But if you're willing to put in the time, effort and dedication to owning them, they will make absolutely wonderful pets and bring you so much joy!
