We would love for the blog to serve as a space for sharing more personal stories, as well as providing information on ferret welfare.

As members of a ferret welfare and rescue society, we often attend social events, shows, and gatherings.

We thought - what better way to show our love for all things ferret than to share some of our show stories! There's nothing like having fond memories to look back on!

So let's start with our first official show! This one may be a little short & dry. But there will be lots more show stories to come!

**The AGM**

The AGM ferret show takes place every year, exclusively for CFWRS members - and their ferrets of course.

This was also the first show that we took Boots & Toots to ourselves.

It was an absolutely lovely atmosphere filled with ferrety enthusiasm.

B&T competed in some show classes and made us so proud. Taking home lots of shiny rosettes and trophies. They loved all the fuss and attention!
