Leading to depression or destructive behaviours. To prevent this, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to provide a variety of enriching activities and toys in your ferrets&amp;rsquo; space and regularly switch them out to keep things fresh and exciting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ideally, you should alternate enrichment activities and toys every week to prevent boredom. This does &lt;em>&lt;strong>not&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> mean you constantly need to buy a surplus of toys (although it can be tempting). But instead, keep some toys aside and switch them out.
