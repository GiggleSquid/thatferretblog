&lt;p>As members of a ferret welfare and rescue society, we often attend social events, shows, and gatherings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We thought - what better way to show our love for all things ferret than to share some of our show stories! There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like having fond memories to look back on!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
