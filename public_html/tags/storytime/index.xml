This has led us to rescue A LOT of animals, from 21 Rats to a selection of reptiles &amp;amp; exotics. Rescuing animals has been a sometimes difficult - but rewarding experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few years ago we had someone reach out to us regarding a post on Facebook marketplace. A single ferret who was kept in poor conditions. Having rescued exotics before and being keen on owning ferrets we accepted and took in this sweet ferret. He was kept in a blank cage with only a chocolate tub full of water and a single plastic Hammock. No enrichment - not even a single blanket to snuggle in. We were eager to bring him home, and we named him Beezlebub (Bubs for short).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
