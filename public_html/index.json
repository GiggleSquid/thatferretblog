[{"content":"Ferrets are highly social animals and thrive with companionship. This post will explore why ferrets need friends and the benefits of having more than 1 ferret. It will also address lone ferrets.\nWhy ferrets need other ferrets It\u0026rsquo;s a common misconception that lone ferrets can \u0026lsquo;be fine\u0026rsquo; on their own, exceptional circumstances notwithstanding. All ferrets should be able to have other ferret friends. It\u0026rsquo;s important to keep ferrets in at least pairs or more.\nSome people would argue that 3+ ferrets is the ideal number. This is because if one ferret is ill or passes away, the remaining 2 ferrets will still have each other.\nUnlike their wild counterparts, polecats, who are not sociable — but tolerable of the same species. Ferrets are the opposite, highly sociable, playful, and loving creatures who thrive best with their own species. Keeping 1 ferret can lead to depression or that ferret not meeting their basic needs in play, enrichment, or welfare.\nOne of the Five basic welfare needs for animals under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 states that the animals should \u0026lsquo;be housed with, or apart from other animals (if applicable)\u0026rsquo; and as needed. The fact it is highlighted within animal welfare legislation means it is generally understood that social animals require companions to best thrive in their environments and meet their essential welfare needs. This does not mean that ferrets MUST have friends, but more so that they need them to thrive (over survive).\nThe Animal Welfare Act 2006 is UK legislation, more info can be found here.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re in a different country or are interested in the laws governing animal welfare law across the globe, you can find relevant Animal Welfare information and legislation from the Global Animal Law Association.\nThe benefits of having multiple ferrets As well as fulfilling a basic welfare need, there are many benefits to owning more than 1 ferret. These may include:\nAllowing ferrets to exhibit more natural behaviours. Living in pairs or more allows the ferrets to exhibit more natural behaviours such as scent marking, chasing, playing with other ferrets, sleeping together, etc. Enrichment. The most enriching thing for a ferret is another ferret! A boost in ferret happiness. Many lone ferret owners report an increase in their ferrets\u0026rsquo; general happiness after adopting a second ferret friend. Socialisation and social stimulation. Ferrets will be able to gain more social stimulation and a better sense of socialisation by interacting with others. Extra ferret play. Ferrets can play with other ferrets differently from how a human and ferret may interact. Allows ferrets to exhibit natural grooming behaviours. Ferrets often lick and groom each other, which they can\u0026rsquo;t do if they\u0026rsquo;re alone. General Companionship. People are not ferrets and cannot offer the same companionship that another ferret may offer. General companionship may include playing, sleeping, grooming, and other previously mentioned behaviours and methods of communication. Reduced stress and boredom. Ferret friends can offer an abundance of interaction, stimulation, and companionship to other ferrets. This will decrease the likelihood of stress and boredom in ferrets. Decreased likelihood of depression. We have personally found that (except for veterinary expenses) owning 2 ferrets is not much different to owning a single ferret. In fact, many ferret owners will frequently say that it is almost less work having multiple ferrets. Cleaning (unless you have a rather large business) does not differ much, nor does the food, stimulation or basic needs.\nThe main differences between owning 2 ferrets rather than 1 are interaction, free-roaming, and veterinary expenses.\nHaving a single ferret means you will need to spend more time engaging, playing, and being with the ferret. Whereas having 2 or more, the ferrets will play with others, entertain and get social stimulation from each other. This does not mean they will not need any free roam. But it does mean that they will be less up your bum and constantly pestering you for play and uppies.\nAddressing lone ferrets Ferrets are often kept as single ferrets for many reasons. These reasons could include:\nMisinformation. Some ferret owners believe that ferrets are fine by themselves and are misinformed. Ferrets are adopted/bought singly. Affordability. Some ferret owners argue that they can\u0026rsquo;t afford a second ferret. Ferret death. If a ferret friend has recently passed away, sometimes the ferret will be kept as a lone ferret for a short period to allow them to grieve. Old age. Similar to the above. Some ferrets are kept alone due to old age after a friend\u0026rsquo;s death. Some ferrets may also be alone if they were adopted out at an old age, have old-age-related injuries, illness\u0026rsquo; or concerns or the owners are not planning to adopt any ferrets and continue their ferret ownership journey. This can be completely valid, as sometimes, rehoming ferrets in their old age can cause them more stress than being alone. Aggression. Some ferrets, particularly those with extreme cases of aggression, those who are older and have been kept alone/unsocialised, or ones with aggressive tendencies will be kept as lone ferrets. Illness/Sickness. Some ferrets who have specific illnesses will be kept quarantined or as lone ferrets for their own/other ferrets\u0026rsquo; safety. In some instances (like some of the ones mentioned above), it is perfectly acceptable to keep a lone ferret. However, if you have a perfectly young and healthy ferret, then it is always best to get them a friend. Not doing so is denying them basic welfare needs.\n\u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;ve always had lone ferrets\u0026rdquo; Both animal care and our understanding of welfare needs constantly change. Although you may have always had lone ferrets and do not see an issue with it, it is now commonly known that ferrets do better in social groups. Depriving them of this is denying them a basic welfare necessity.\n\u0026ldquo;My ferret is alone and is just fine\u0026rdquo; Although your ferret may appear fine and not display any outward signs of depression, many owners report that even their supposedly happy and fulfilled single ferrets have thrived more when introduced to a friend. Just because your ferret outwardly appears happy does not mean they do not need a friend.\n\u0026ldquo;I always spend time with my ferret and can take the place of a friend\u0026rdquo; Even if you spend all your time, 24/7, with a ferret. You are not a ferret. Humans cannot provide the same amount or level of interaction, socialisation, comfort, etc. As another ferret could. We also cannot outwardly communicate with the ferrets. So, getting your ferret a friend will still be beneficial for them. This is also relevant to other species.\n\u0026ldquo;I cannot afford more than 1 ferret\u0026rdquo; As above, except for veterinary fees. Keeping 2 ferrets is not much more expensive than keeping 1. If you cannot support the essentials and meet basic welfare needs for your ferret, then you may want to consider alternative options.\n","permalink":"https://thatferret.blog/posts/why-ferrets-need-friends/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFerrets are highly social animals and thrive with companionship.

Raw 101 will be a series of posts on raw feeding (you can find all relevant posts on the series page). This is the main guide to all things raw and will include, kibble vs raw (condensed), ferret nutrition, types of diets and the amount of raw.\nWhy raw and not kibble? Our blog will mainly discuss raw feeding as it is our preference, we have conducted much research on both raw feeding and kibble feeding to determine this. Raw food has many benefits for ferrets that kibble does not provide. These benefits include but are not limited to:\nHigher % of proteins in the food. Not having to have food available 24/7. Consuming less food (as raw is more nutrient-dense). Can be more cost-effective. Increase in energy. Better formed and less smelly poos. Better fur condition. Benefits for ferrets teeth. Better overall digestion and gut health. Reduced smell. A more natural diet for ferrets (over commercial and factory-made kibbles). Ferrets seem to enjoy it more (anecdotal). Can I feed both Kibble \u0026amp; Raw? Many people ask, \u0026ldquo;Can I feed both kibble and raw?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Can I feed 2 raw meals a week and kibble the rest of the time\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Can I feed raw meals but offer kibble 24/7?\u0026rdquo;, etc.\nThe short answer is no, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t feed both kibble and raw either interchangeably or at the same time.\nThis is because of the differences in how kibble and raw are digested, and how nutrients are broken down. So by feeding both — the digestive characteristics and overall gut microbiota change which can lead to the ferret being unable to effectively digest/absorb nutrients and causing unprocessed runny poos. In the long run, if the ferret\u0026rsquo;s nutritional needs are unmet or imbalanced, it can lead to various health concerns.\nFerret nutrition The nature of the Ferret Ferrets are obligate carnivores, naturally they will, almost exclusively, eat animal flesh. Ferrets lack the digestive equipment to process plant matter. Alongside their wild counterpart (the European Polecat) they are designed to be carnivorous predators, subsisting on whole prey or carrion.\nThe digestion of the Ferret Ferrets (and some other mustelidae) have unusually short intestinal tracts. They lack a caecum and ileocaecal valve, which results in very quick movement of ingested foods through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Because of this, their food is not digested very efficiently.\nThis is more or less the nutritional reason raw diets are better for ferrets than kibble. Simply put, raw food is significantly more nutritionally dense, and those nutrients also tend to be more bioavailable than kibble. Therefore, there are just more nutrients available to extract during the short time it\u0026rsquo;s in the GI tract.\nBiologically appropriate diets The goal here is to create a diet that mimics, as closely as possible, the potential natural diet. In the case of ferrets, this is primarily small mammals, birds, and the occasional river fish. There are many names for variations of biologically appropriate diets:\nRaw diet PMR (Prey Model Raw) Whole prey Frankenprey BARF (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food or Bones And Raw Food) RMB (Raw Meaty Bones) These all mostly mean the same thing, the distinguishing features are usually slightly different proportions, preparation, or feeding methods. But all you need to know is what ferrets actually need.\nWhat ferrets need Amino acids — These are what proteins are made of. Essential amino acids — an amino acid that cannot be synthesised fast enough if at all. These must come from the diet. Taurine — Extremely abundant in heart tissues. Much like cats, ferrets cannot biosynthesise taurine from cysteine. Other essential amino acids — Unfortunately there is little research on specific ferret dietary requirements so I cannot say any more on this topic. Fats — Ferrets are generally high-metabolism animals, they burn through energy rather quickly. As such, they tend to require relatively high-fat diets. Remember to always monitor their weight, though. Vitamins — Are needed in the body to perform many functions. Vitamins A, D, and E are all fat-soluble and build up in fat tissues, overabundance of these vitamins can lead to toxicity. Please take special care with liver as it is a concentrated source of vitamin A. The B complexes are all water-soluble and thus excess is excreted in the urine. Macrominerals — Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, and Chloride all serve vital bodily functions. Macromineral requirements are usually measured in mg (milligrams). Microminerals — Iron, Copper, Zinc, Manganese, Selenium, and Iodine all serve vital bodily functions. Iodine is utilised in the synthesis of thyroid hormones, it\u0026rsquo;s frequently under-supplied in many diets. Micromineral requirements are typically measured in mcg (micrograms) or the low mg. The notable absence of carbs — As said previously, ferrets are obligate carnivores, and are not designed to eat sugars, complex or otherwise. Carbs in ferret diets can lead to Insulinoma due to the strain on the pancreas producing insulin to counteract the blood glucose levels. The notable absence of plant matter — As mentioned previously, ferrets are obligate carnivores and lack the necessary gastrointestinal components to digest plant matter. In many cases, it is actively detrimental to their health. Types of raw Prey model raw (PMR) PMR is designed to remove processed foods and to mimic an animal\u0026rsquo;s natural, wild diet. The ratios of PMR are modelled on the components of whole prey.\nThe ratios of this diet are often tailored to a specific animal. For ferrets, the below is generally accepted.\nMuscle Meat Edible Bone Heart Liver Other organ 65-70% 10-15% 10% 5% 5% Whole-prey Whole-prey feeding is arguably the best and most natural way for ferrets to consume meals, as each whole-prey item is a complete, balanced meal (incl. all organs, blood, flesh, bones, and fur). However, some ferrets are not adjusted to eat whole prey, and some ferret owners cannot provide whole prey regularly due to cost, resources, cleanup, etc.\nYou can source whole prey from online sites or some pet stores (although pet shops normally only stock a selection of mice or rats). Whole prey can range from adult mice, rats, guinea pigs, birds, etc. Some people may even opt to hunt and feed home-caught prey.\nNote: Undeveloped prey such as pinkies, fuzzies, pups, rabbit kits, etc. do not count towards being nutritionally balanced as a meal and should only be fed as a treat.\nFrakenprey Frankenprey follows the same concepts as whole-prey or PMR with two notable differences:\nThe use of multiple animal proteins/parts. There is usually no fur/feathers. The goal is the same — to provide a diet following the PMR ratio guidelines.\nModified 80/10/10 If you decide to purchase pre-mixed raw, 80/10/10 is an option when modified. Ensure the mix is suitable for ferrets, and avoid \u0026lsquo;complete\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;chub\u0026rsquo; sausages specifically for dogs. Many of these pre-mixes contain plant matter which is not digestible for ferrets.\nThe downside of 80/10/10 is that you must modify it to make it nutritionally complete.\nModifying 80/10/10 is deceptively complex. There\u0026rsquo;s no formula we know of that can represent the twiddling of proportions needed to achieve the required PMR ratios.\nI\u0026rsquo;d also add that I think this is more trouble than it\u0026rsquo;s worth. Most of the time, you still don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what\u0026rsquo;s in it. It\u0026rsquo;s all well and good listing turkey offal, but how much liver is that, if any?\nBut if you still want to give it a try, here\u0026rsquo;s what you should add to some common sizes of 80/10/10 (in the UK).\nFor 500g, add:\nBone Heart Liver 10g 60g 30g For 1kg, add:\nBone Heart Liver 20g 120g 60g This should leave you with\nMuscle meat Bone Offal Heart Liver 66.67% 10.00% 8.33% 10.00% 5.00% Please keep an eye out for 80/10/10 that explicitly contains liver, it is abundant in vitamin A, and over time, if fed in excess, this vitamin accumulates in fat tissues and could lead to vitamin A toxicity (Hypervitaminosis A).\nFreeze-dried raw (FDR) Freeze drying is the process of removing water from a frozen material. It is often used in the preservation of food. The process of freeze-drying does not affect the enzymes of the food making it nutritionally comparable to standard raw, except for the lack of moisture. Many choose freeze-dried raw if they do not want to prepare raw themselves or only have a certain amount of kitchen space.\nIt is important when choosing a freeze-dried raw that you get one as high in protein as possible. Many FDR options do come in 100% meat variety. But some FDR particularly the ones marketed towards dogs can include harmful plant matter or fillers.\nYou can find reputable FDR brands online or at local raw pet food suppliers. But FDR will be harder to find than regular frozen raw. There is a difference!\nFrozen raw is usually 80/10/10 or pre-grounded single protein raw stored in the freezer. Freeze-dried raw refers to the process as outlined above. Before feeding your ferret FDR food ensure that it is rehydrated. This is because moisture within food helps aid digestion. If you do not rehydrate FDR, once eaten the food will absorb the water in the ferret\u0026rsquo;s stomach leading to potential dehydration, constipation, or intestinal blockages.\nLive feeding Live feeding is banned across many countries, including the UK. There are many laws, regulations, and legislation that need to be taken into account when considering live feeding. More information on whole prey feeding and live feeding can be found on the Holistic Ferret Forum Website (linked in the source list).\nLive feeding is widely considered to be cruel. It is usually only employed by professionals in suitable environments where the animal needs to be fed live prey for medical, nutritional, or other health purposes.\nAmount \u0026amp; percentages of Raw Adult ferrets require around 7% of their body weight in raw food per day.\nKits require around 10% of their body weight in raw food per day.\nRaw can be fed at set schedules (one meal in the AM and one in the PM) or fed little and often throughout the day. It is a common misconception that food must be available to ferrets 24/7. However, this is only the case when kibble feeding, as it is a poorer quality food. The ferrets are not able to fully absorb nutrients from kibble meaning they need to eat it more regularly, with raw you do not have this issue. Set meal times for raw will be sufficient.\nThe amount of raw is based on the \u0026lsquo;Prey Model Raw\u0026rsquo; (PMR). These percentages line up with the frankenprey diet. So to enable your Raw to be nutritionally complete, you will want to follow these percentage guidelines.\n65-70% Muscle Meat. 10-15% Edible Bone (bone-in meat content). 10% Heart. 5% Liver. 5% Other Organ. Note: Bone-in meat or Edible bone does not refer to straight-up bone. It refers to the flesh and bone together (such as whole chicken wings or minced carcass, which is generally about 40% bone content).\nNote: \u0026lsquo;Other organ\u0026rsquo; refers to secreting organs, these are metabolic or hormone-secreting, like kidneys or testicles. Organs such as lungs are counted as muscle meat.\nWorking out raw amounts Now you should know the mass of raw food needed (in relation to the ferret\u0026rsquo;s age and weight), as well as the breakdown of percentages for the contents of a balanced raw meal. But you may still be struggling to work out how much raw to feed.\nExample You have an adult hob who is 1500g (ca. 3.3 lbs). He would need around 7% of his weight in raw food per day, which equates to 105g.\nMixing 105g of raw using the PMR percentages would equate to (in this instance, I am using 70% muscle meat and 10% edible bone):\n73.5g Muscle Meat. 10.5g Edible Bone/Bone-in. 10.5g Heart. 5.25g Liver. 5.25g Other Organ. In short, those would be the percentages used to make 105g of food based on an example ferret weight. If you want to batch-make raw food, you would multiply the day amount of food by the number of days you\u0026rsquo;d like to pre-mix for.\nIn other words, you would have to weigh your ferret to get their weight and find out the quantity using the PMR reference percentages and that would equate to a day of raw food.\nAdjusting based on leftovers After establishing a base amount of food to start with, using the ferret\u0026rsquo;s weight as explained above, you should monitor how much your ferrets are actually eating. Ferrets don\u0026rsquo;t really overeat, they\u0026rsquo;re great at self-regulation.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s no food left after meal time you should increase the quantity in small amounts until there are leftovers. Weigh the leftovers to find out how much remains and reduce the food quantity until there are only a few grams left after each meal.\nThis ensures your ferrets are getting enough food whilst keeping waste to a minimum.\nA little food left in the bowl means happy, full ferrets.\nMeal prepping You\u0026rsquo;ll want to consider any meal preparation needed to produce raw food and what method you\u0026rsquo;d like to use. There are a few options:\nModifying 80/10/10 raw. Buying pre-ground to mix yourself. Grinding and mixing yourself. Purchasing a pre-mix or pre-ground will be less time-consuming, but may be more costly in the long run. Grinding and mixing yourself may work out cheaper but takes more time, storage, and equipment, and can be tedious.\nSelf Preparation If you choose to self-prep and mix, then there are plenty of options for raw suppliers. Our personal favourite is Raw Pet Supplies (a link can be found in the sources section of this post). On top of where to source food, you will need to consider preparation methods and kitchen aids. Here\u0026rsquo;s a post about our favourites.\nPreparing raw yourself has many advantages and disadvantages. It comes down to base preference.\nAdvantages may include:\nKnowing exactly what makes up the food. Being able to modify the food and change the recipes easily. Being able to choose how much food to prep. Being able to pick and switch proteins to suit personal preference, ferret preference, or seasonality. Being able to modify food for potential allergies and illnesses. Disadvantages may include:\nFreezer and fridge space/facilities. Kitchen supply start-up costs. Keeping on top of ordering, mixing and defrosting food. It can be rather time-consuming and tedious. Meal prepping in advance is beneficial when feeding a raw diet to increase longevity and stop potential meat spoil. You may want to consider how much raw you\u0026rsquo;d like to prepare in advance taking into account freezer space and facilities.\nImportance of protein variation Whether you are feeding pre-ground raw, frankenprey or whole prey raw, you need to take into account protein variation. This applies to muscle meat, bone-in content, and organs.\nFerrets should have a minimum of 4–5 interchangeable proteins within their raw feeding plans. Having protein variations ensures the ferrets do not get bored with their food, it provides a change in diet and variety!\nImagine eating a steak every single day. You\u0026rsquo;d feel sick after a while and probably develop an illness from not obtaining any other sources of nutrition. It\u0026rsquo;s the same for ferrets. Too much poultry or red meat can cause several health-related issues. So making sure a variety is given is essential.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to know more about the importance of protein variation have a read of this article on the Holistic Ferret Forum\nThe simplest way to offer variety The easiest way to offer protein variety would be to change the muscle meats offered and change the other organ option. This would suffice in hitting the 4-5 protein varieties needed. However, you can also opt to feed different types of hearts, livers and bones.\nSome muscle meat protein options Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Pork/Boar, Beef, Lamb, Venison, Fish (watch out for mercury levels in fish. Salmon, Sardine, and Atlantic Mackerel are great options). Some other organ options Testicle, Uterus, Spleen, Pancreas, Kidney, Brain. This concludes Raw Feeding 101!

From pouncing and digging to the famous \u0026lsquo;weasel war dance\u0026rsquo; this blog post will run through some of the most common ferret behaviours and why they do them!\nI have organised these behaviours into 8 separate categories.\nPlayful Behaviours War dancing Also referred to as the \u0026lsquo;weasel war dance\u0026rsquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s a series of jumps, hops, twists and dooking which normally result in invitations to play, chase or capture a toy. Ferrets will war dance at you or other ferrets, it\u0026rsquo;s a sign they\u0026rsquo;re very excited! In the wild, ferrets war dance to confuse their prey or other predatory species.\nChasing Ferrets will chase each other or you, they may also invite you to chase them in return. Chasing followed with positive behaviours such as jumping, dooking or war dancing is one of the many ways they play.\nWrestling Ferrets will often wrestle with each other. A lot of people may confuse wrestling with fighting or dominance behaviours. But wrestling when engaged with other positive behaviours is another form of ferret play. Ferrets may pounce, jump, bite or roll around with each other. Wrestling is normally followed by dooking, war dancing, or chasing.\nDigging It\u0026rsquo;s a natural behaviour for ferrets and is a great form of enrichment. Ferrets may dig at objects, carpet/flooring or places they\u0026rsquo;re not supposed to (like their litter boxes). To combat this, you can offer your ferrets a dig box full of uncooked rice, or a ball pit to dig in. Ferrets will sometimes fully submerge their heads or bodies in dig boxes. Digging is a great way for them to remain engaged, and entertained and file down their nails.\nTail wagging Similar to dogs, when playing — some ferrets will wag their tails to show they are excited. Ferrets with stronger personalities will be more likely to wag their tails.\nHere are a few video examples of ferrets engaging in playful behaviours:\nWar dancing\nPlay wrestling\nDigging\nTail wagging\nDominance Behaviours Bum sniffing Ferrets will sniff each other\u0026rsquo;s bums as a means of communication or as a greeting. But they will primarily sniff bums as a sign of asserting dominance. This isn\u0026rsquo;t usually a means of concern. By bum sniffing, the ferrets can tell if one another is familiar and establish a dominant or submissive social status within their group.\nChasing \u0026amp; Stalking These behaviours are seen in aggressive-dominant ferrets. The dominant ferret will usually stalk or continuously chase other ferrets into corners before lunging or biting. This type of chasing should not be confused with a play chase. The differentiating factor for dominance chasing and stalking is that the dominant ferret will not allow the other ferret(s) to distance themselves or hide. There will also be signs of vocal distress from both sides and/or hissing.\nAlligator roll This is often seen in dominance wrestling or when playful rough-housing elevates too abruptly. Ferrets will pin another ferret, bite their necks or scruffs and flip them over. Sometimes the ferrets may roll in this position 3—4 times, giving it the name \u0026lsquo;alligator roll\u0026rsquo;. If ferrets are biting the front-throat areas of the neck during this, are making alarming sounds, drawing blood or one of them pees or poos itself they should be separated immediately.\nWith dominance behaviours, one of the biggest questions people have is \u0026lsquo;Are my ferrets fighting or playing?\u0026rsquo;.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a YouTube video discussing and showing the differences.\nFrightened Behaviours Fleeing Ferrets flee when they are scared, startled or frightened. Fleeing is rather simple. The ferret will run and hide. If you approach a fleeing ferret, they will likely try to run away or may fear bite you.\nHiding Frightened ferrets may hide away from people or other ferrets. They will curl up to make themselves as small and discreet as possible, often pushing themselves into small or tight spaces out of sight.\nBiting Frightened ferrets may fear bite, this will be very different to a gentle play bite or nip. Ferrets that are scared will normally bite and latch onto your skin, 9/10 drawing blood.\nHere are a few video examples of frightened ferrets:\nScared rescue ferret (examples of vocalisations and frightened behaviours/biting)\nGenerally anxious ferret\nGrooming Behaviours Grooming themselves Ferrets will groom themselves by scratching, licking and biting their coats (much like cats). This will aid them in removing any loose fur, debris, or oil build-up. Ferrets are rather clean animals and will groom themselves and each other multiple times per day.\nGrooming you Ferrets that are heavily bonded to you may also enjoy helping you groom. This means they will lick and nibble you and may snuffle/nuzzle into your hair, and attempt to clean your ears, fingers arms or beards (if you have facial hair). This is a big compliment from a ferret — they groom you because they love you!\nHere are a few video examples of ferret grooming:\nGrooming themself\nGrooming each other\nFerret grooming their owner\nPotty Behaviours Scooting into corners Ferrets can be seen backing up into corners to do their ferrety business. When a ferret looks for a corner and starts to back up, they are going to potty. This is because in the wild, ferrets who poo in the open may get snatched up by birds, but, a ferret who has backed up into a corner is still able to defend itself at any moment.\nProtest Pooping This is a behaviour that only some ferrets do. Despite the stigma of ferrets being smelly or unclean — they are incredibly clean animals. This means if the litter box is too soiled for their liking, or you have done something to displease them. Some ferrets will \u0026lsquo;fight back\u0026rsquo; or alert you to change their litter box by pooping in open, unpredictable or very inconvenient (for you) places on purpose. Many ferrents have called this protest pooping, some ferrets may even stare at you directly while they protest poo.\nEating \u0026amp; Drinking Behaviours Dunking heads into water bowls Some ferrets can be seen dunking or fully submerging their heads into their water bowls with open mouths. This can leave quite a mess as ferrets spill and flick their water around. In the wild, ferrets will dunk their heads in rivers and streams to find food sources or to cool down. Domesticated ferrets may still have an urge to do the same in their water bowls (or they might just be having fun splashing around in the water!)\nDigging in food bowls As previously mentioned, ferrets love to dig! If you don\u0026rsquo;t provide appropriate enrichment allowing ferrets to exercise their digging desires, they may reach for the next best thing. Which will be digging at their food bowls or even litter boxes.\nStashing food Stashing is one of the most common ferret behaviours (more about stashing generally will be below). But stashing food in particular is normally reserved for certain ferrets. There can be many reasons ferrets stash food:\nThey may just be super lazy and want to hide some food in an easy-to-reach place to snack on later. They may be hiding it from other ferrets. They may be hiding it due to resource scarcity and fear of not getting more food. Usually stashing food is not a problem as ferrets will eat it later, or you can clean it up. For possessive ferrets, however, food stashing can become an issue if they attempt to resource guard it from you or other ferrets. This can quickly spiral into food aggression in ferrets and will need to be looked into by the appropriate professional. Ferrets may also stash food more in the colder seasons.\nHere are a few video examples of ferrets displaying food-related behaviours:\nHead dunking \u0026amp; digging in water\nStashing food. Note: the ferret in this video is stashing goldfish crackers, do not feed your ferret human foods!\nSleeping Behaviours Dead sleep Some ferrets will fall into such a deep sleep that they will appear completely still or \u0026lsquo;dead\u0026rsquo;. This can scare owners the first time they see it, but it\u0026rsquo;s not generally a cause for concern. Some ferrets in extremely heavy dead sleep may even be unresponsive to you gently tapping, handling or attempting to wake them up. As long as they are still warm to the touch and breathing, then they are fine! Just very… VERY asleep.\nCuddling Ferrets will cuddle each other as a means of affection and warmth. It shows that they are fully bonded and happy with each other. Multiple ferrets (more than 2) cuddling is often called the \u0026lsquo;cuddle puddle\u0026rsquo;. Ferrets love feeling warm and cosy. Some ferrets (not all) may also like to cuddle with you — although this is normally seen when they are older and more relaxed.\nHere are a few video examples of ferret sleeping habits:\nFalling asleep dramatically\nDead sleep example 1\nDead sleep example 2\nNote: We do not recommend disturbing your ferret unnecessarily during dead sleep\nOther Behaviours Stashing Ferrets stash things as an instinctive behaviour. This stems from stockpiling food after hunting, but in domesticated ferrets, this instinct can manifest as hoarding toys or household objects.\nPancake/Flop This is when a ferret lays down, sprawled out on the floor. This is also known as \u0026lsquo;puddling\u0026rsquo; because when they lay like this — they look like a little ferret puddle. Ferrets can typically be seen pancaking after eating or during breaks in play. It can show a range of things such as small rest periods between play, the ferret is tired, bored or wanting attention. It can also be when a ferret is submitting to another ferret after dominance, during rough-housing or playing.\nChin rubbing Ferrets rub their chins along or on surfaces as a form of scent marking and chemical communication. The scent marking of domesticated ferrets is less pronounced, so they won\u0026rsquo;t chin rub as often. In the wild, ferrets will rub their chins on surfaces and leave a chemical scent of warning or potential danger to other ferrets.\nDomesticated ferrets will rub their chins on you to claim you as their own. They may also rub their chins on specific areas or toys that they show a more prominent liking to. This will claim the toys or areas as theirs — although they will still happily share these with other bonded ferret friends and should not show signs of possessiveness. Chin rubbing is vastly different from when ferrets rub their faces along surfaces.\nBiting A tool of communication for ferrets. They\u0026rsquo;re not able to gesticulate or speak like humans. So most of their communication is through body postures, sounds, and biting! There are 3 main types of ferret bite: play biting, fear biting, and nips. Ferrets have much tougher skin than us, so biting can sometimes cause indentations or bleeding unintentionally. 9/10 ferrets will only bite as a means of initiating play. They\u0026rsquo;re trying to say \u0026ldquo;Hey, Hello! I want to play now\u0026rdquo;. Play bites vary in amount/force depending on your ferret, generally, hobs will bite harder than jills.\nAnother form of ferret bite is a ferret nip. These nips are much sharper and shorter than a play bite and are used to tell you something like \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t touch me\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Put me down, please\u0026rdquo;. These bites are not malicious — but simply a way for your ferret to communicate as they do with their furry friends. Fear biting, in short, refers to more prominent biting, latching, or shaking. This will be seen in anxious/fearful ferrets, ferrets which have been neglected or not socialised properly. These are the worst types of bites to address, as they often cause a great deal of pain and the root issue is harder to manage.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that ferrets are hunting animals, they could easily take one of your fingers off. So if they\u0026rsquo;re not eating your fingers, they\u0026rsquo;re not likely trying to be aggressive. A bite-specific post going into more detail will be made in the future!\nBottlebrush tail This refers to when a ferret\u0026rsquo;s tail gets all spiky and poofy! It may resemble a bottle brush or pipe cleaner. When a ferret has a bottle brush tail, it means that it has big feelings of some kind. This can be split into 2 categories: aggression and big feels! Many people talk about the aggressive side of the bottle brush tail, meaning the ferret is unhappy. Many ferrets displaying dominant behaviours may experience bottle brush tails when things get a little out of hand. But it\u0026rsquo;s important to also note that some ferrets bottle brush when they are experiencing big positive feels! Mainly excitement or playfulness! Bottlebrush tail is similar to a dog that raises their hackles. It\u0026rsquo;s an involuntary reaction to feelings.\nHere are a few video examples of other ferret behaviours:\nStashing\nBottlebrush tail\nGeneral ferret behaviours\nFerrets may also display lots of other behaviours to fit their wide scope of personalities. If your ferret rapidly changes their behaviour or is acting lethargic in any way, it is important to consult a vet.\nMore about ferret Pooting/Puffing can be found in the blog post: L\u0026rsquo;odeur du furet, aka The smell.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to read about common ferret vocalisations, you can see the blog post here.\n","permalink":"https://thatferret.blog/posts/basic-ferret-behaviours/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFerrets display a wide variety of behaviours.

This blog post will highlight some common ferret sounds and their meanings!\nDooking Dooking is probably the most well-known ferret vocalisation. It often sounds like a soft and repetitive \u0026lsquo;clucking\u0026rsquo; sound, which can vary in pitch. Ferrets mostly dook when they\u0026rsquo;re happy. But there are actually multiple types of ferret dooking!\nSuch as:\nHappy dooks. The most commonly known sound, ferrets will dook when feeling happy, playful or excited. Some ferrets don\u0026rsquo;t dook — this doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they\u0026rsquo;re unhappy, it could just mean they were never taught how to dook!\nThe dominance dook. Ferrets can dook for dominance when rough-housing or winning an argument with another ferret.\nThe annoyance dook. This can happen if your ferret keeps trying to get something and you interfere. It can also be a warning signal before a bite occurs.\nThe horny dook. Hobs who are in season will dook around Jill\u0026rsquo;s when feeling frisky. This is also known as a \u0026lsquo;hob song\u0026rsquo;.\nMother dooking. A Jill will call out for her kits to return by making a series of low, rapid fire dooking sounds.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a video example of ferret dooking:\nHissing Ferrets will hiss when frightened or angry, they may also hiss as a sign to say \u0026lsquo;back off\u0026rsquo;. Ferrets will hiss at people or their other ferret friends as a means of communication, they are normally trying to convey that they are agitated and to leave them alone. Some ferrets may also hiss at other ferrets when they are rough-housing or biting too hard. If the hiss is short, then it is nothing to worry about. But, if the hiss is prolonged, low pitch or is accompanied by biting, hiding, fleeing, sulking, or other \u0026lsquo;bad\u0026rsquo; vocalizations then it is a sign that your ferret is in major distress.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a video example of ferret hissing:\nLaughing/Huffing Huffing is commonly known as ferret laughter. It\u0026rsquo;s a panting sound or a series of breaths, inhaling and exhaling quickly. Huffing is usually seen in younger kits. But older ferrets may laugh when they\u0026rsquo;re super excited.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a video example of ferret laughter:\nBarking This is a rarer sound. Sometimes, when trapped, in distress, or startled, ferrets will make a distinct barking sound.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a video example of ferret barking:\nPlease note: The ferret in this video is being bathed and is clearly in distress. The laughing from the owners shows a clear misunderstanding of the seriousness of the vocalisations.\nScreaming Ferrets will scream when they are in extreme distress, have been injured or are in extreme pain. Some ferrets may also scream when having a seizure. Screaming is a very distinct sound that can be quite frightening to hear.\nNote: While there are videos depicting this, ferrets will only scream when experiencing high stress, I did not want to link a video. The video at the end of this post has an audio-only example of ferret screaming.\nDeaf ferret noises Ferrets who are deaf are notorious for making \u0026lsquo;socially inappropriate\u0026rsquo; sounds, which can often be misinterpreted as the ferret being in pain. These sounds range from hissing, screaming and screeching to strange clucking, puffing and clicking sounds. Deaf ferrets can\u0026rsquo;t hear themselves, so they are more vocal. It\u0026rsquo;s important to decipher if your ferret is making inappropriate sounds because they are deaf, or making appropriate sounds because they are in pain or distress. You can do this by keeping a close eye on other behaviours and body language. The more you socialise with your deaf ferret, the more you will understand what vocalizations are normal for them.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a video example of a deaf ferret playing \u0026amp; the vocalizations it makes:\nSneezing Ferret sneezing is normal, it helps to clear the nose of irritants. Sometimes they\u0026rsquo;ll have a burst of short sneezes, referred to as rapid sneezing. However, if sneezing is persistent or accompanied by symptoms such as discharge, coughing, or lethargy, it could indicate illness.\nSnoring Ferrets can snore, but kits typically snore more at a higher pitch. Ferret snores are usually quiet and soft but can become an issue if your ferret is overweight and has problems with breathing (similar to sleep apnoea in humans).\nWhimpering Ferrets may whimper when they are in pain or discomfort. The whimpers will be airy short huffing sounds, often accompanied by shallow fast chest movements or breath intakes. Some ferrets may also whimper if they feel they are not getting enough attention or not getting their way (like if you\u0026rsquo;ve taken away a specific toy or their food).\nWhining Similar to whimpering, whining can be higher pitch and much more frequent. Kits may whine to gain attention from their mothers.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a video example of ferret whining:\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to recap vocalizations or hear more sounds that ferrets make, here is a video that shows 14 common ferret vocalizations with examples:\nWant to know about basic ferret behaviours?

It will include ferret colours, patterns, markings, mask specifics and nose colours.\nBefore diving into ferret colours, there are a couple of definitions. These will help you determine your ferrets\u0026rsquo; colour \u0026amp; pattern.\nUndercoat The general under-fur of the ferret. Gives ferrets their overall colour appearance. Guard hairs The very top/tips of the ferret fur. Masks The mark around the ferret\u0026rsquo;s eyes. Ferret Colours Albino Albino ferrets lack colour pigmentation, meaning they appear all white. If ferrets have any coloured fur including guard hairs, or dark eyes, they are not considered Albino. Albino ferrets will have bright red eyes. This is due to a lack of colour pigmentation, it is not the colour red. Albino ferrets may also have a faint yellow colour due to the secreting of skin oils. Silver/Roan Silver ferrets will have 50% or more guard hairs, which are white. Usually, silver ferrets will gain more white hairs every time they shed. This is often called \u0026lsquo;roaning out\u0026rsquo; until they become a DEW (Dark-eyed white). Dark-eyed white (DEW) DEW ferrets appear white all over. Similar to Albino ferrets, they may also have a yellow hue due to oils. The main difference is DEW ferrets will have dark eyes. Black Black ferrets have dark black fur. There are many varieties of black ferrets based on patterns and markings. Black ferrets may be solid or partially black. Champagne/Sandy Most commonly known as Sandy ferrets, these ferrets have tan-appearing legs and tails and a light cream to white undercoat. Sandy ferrets will have bronze/brown guard hairs, vary in eye colours but will often have a pink nose. Sandy ferrets masks and coats may become faint during summer. Chocolate Chocolate ferrets come in all patterns and markings. Known for their chocolate-coloured medium-brown to dark-brown coats. They may sometimes have lighter-appearing guard hairs. In the US, many ferrets labelled as \u0026lsquo;Cinnamon\u0026rsquo;, especially those from Marshalls, are in fact chocolate. Cinnamon Cinnamon ferrets are VERY rare. They are a variation of Champagne/Sandy ferrets with a prominent red hue. Sable/Polecat Typically, the most common ferret colour. Sables are a dark colour with a cream-beige undercoat. This varies depending on the individual ferret and the season. Ferret Patterns Blaze The Blaze pattern is not present in white ferrets. It is defined as a long stripe on top of the head that runs down the back of the ferret. Mutt Mutt patterns consist of spots, splotches, roaning and other patterns. Typically, ferrets which are Mutt are multiple colours and do not have any distinct patterns or markings. Panda The Panda pattern is not present in white ferrets. Panda ferrets have almost fully white heads, with darker patches around the shoulders and hips. They will usually not have a mask but instead have small rings of colour around the eyes and ears (like Pandas!) Solid Also not present in white ferrets. True solid ferrets will have no white hairs, including no white guard hairs. Standard Similar to the solid pattern. Standard patterns may have white guard hairs. Their overall colours are less concentrated and other markings may be present. Patterned/Stripe Appears in all colours except for white. Patterned ferrets will typically have white guard hairs, coloured spots or patches and a stripe going down their backs. Mitt The Mitt pattern is not present in white ferrets. Mitt ferrets will have white Mitt markings on the feet and Bib markings. Point Also not present in white ferrets, but will be present in all other colours. Point ferrets will have an obvious difference between their coat colour and different points. The points can be present on the shoulders, legs, and tail in addition to their mask. Roaning Roaning is mainly seen in Silver/Roan ferrets but can appear in other colours except white. Roaning ferrets will have 40-60% of their guard hairs white, giving it a \u0026lsquo;salt \u0026amp; pepper\u0026rsquo; effect. Ferret Markings/Details Bib A patch under their neck, giving the ferret the appearance of wearing a Bib. Mutt Random appearing white marks. Milk Mouth A white circular patch around the ferret\u0026rsquo;s mouth. Milk Toes White markings on the tip or entirety of the ferret\u0026rsquo;s toes. These marks will not extend past the feet. Mitt White markings on the ferret\u0026rsquo;s feet, which extend to the ankles. Stocking Similar to mitts, but the white marks will extend partially-fully up the leg. Points White or coloured markings on the shoulders, legs, tail, and mask. Other Other markings can range from patches on the back, tail, knees, shoulders, or chest. Ferret Masks Standard/Full A solid and prominent band around and between both eyes. A classic mask appearance. T bar A solid band around and in between both eyes and extended to the top of the head. The T bar would resemble an upside-down letter \u0026lsquo;T\u0026rsquo;. V Mask A thinner band which extends down to the nose. Resembles the letter \u0026lsquo;V\u0026rsquo;. Warpaint No apparent mask but can have patches of colour around the eyes. Common in silver and panda ferrets. Ferret Nose Colours/Markings Pink A full pink nose. Black A full dark-black nose. Pale A pale off-pink/cream-coloured nose. Cleft A nose which folds on both sides, usually most apparent in Angora ferrets. Tuffed Only appears on Cleft noses. Tuffed refers to noses which have extended/patches of fur on them. Dotted Noses that are typically pink/pale with a singular dot on them. Speckled Noses that are typically pink/pale with multiple dots on them, giving them a speckled effect. Inverted Speckled Noses which are the opposite of Speckled. Noses are often brown-black with lighter dots on them. Brown T Noses which are pink with a brown \u0026lsquo;T\u0026rsquo; letter resemblance on them.

While it\u0026rsquo;s true, ferrets do smell — like ferrets, all animals have a smell. Ferrets, however, get a terrible reputation for being stinky. So, what makes odeur de furet? Why are they stigmatised for having a bad smell?\nWell, ferrets have a natural musky odour because of their scent glands. Scent glands are situated throughout the whole body. But are primarily in the anal area, which they use for marking.\nFerrets release a smell to mark territory and attract mates. When male ferrets are particularly hormonal, they normally smell pretty strong, especially if they\u0026rsquo;re not neutered.\nFerrets in some countries are subject to a procedure that removes their anal glands (called de-scenting) this supposedly reduces their odour but doesn\u0026rsquo;t completely get rid of it. In parts of Europe, this procedure is actually illegal, as it\u0026rsquo;s considered highly unethical. De-scenting is a stressful surgery which can have high risks and complications. Many ferrets that undergo de-scenting are very young, and the procedure takes away some of their ability to communicate. Some people would even consider it a form of mutilation. De-scenting is rendered pretty useless, and the marketing is completely wrong. It gives people the impression that ferrets will no longer smell, when in fact, like all animals, they do! Why put a ferret under so much unnecessary stress?\nThere are many ways to make a ferret less smelly, which are much more ethical and do not involve a procedure such as de-scenting. Some examples include:\nSwitching your ferret to a raw-based diet. Cleaning the ferrets\u0026rsquo; litter boxes regularly. Choosing a high-quality absorbent litter (paper-based). Washing bedding and fabrics often. Hoovering and cleaning the carpet that your ferret is in contact with. Air purifiers. A common misconception is that if your ferret smells, you should bathe it. This is FALSE. Ferrets do not need baths and should not be submerged in water or covered in shampoo (even if it\u0026rsquo;s marketed towards ferrets).\nBathing a ferret will actually do the complete opposite, and will make them even more smelly! This is because when you bathe a ferret, you strip all the skin\u0026rsquo;s naturally secreting oils. This means after the bath, the ferret\u0026rsquo;s body will go into overdrive to replace these oils and your ferret will end up even smellier.\nBathing ferrets can also be highly stressful and cause skin dryness, extreme itchiness or general discomfort to your ferret.\nSaying this, you may offer your ferret an oat milk bath during shedding season if they are experiencing over itchiness, flakey, or tender skin. Oat milk baths are shallow baths with either oat milk, or rolled oats in a sock. Placed in about 5 cm (ca. 2 inches) of water. You will want to make sure there is a mat or towel on the bottom of the bath, so the ferrets do not slide around. And you will not want to bathe them more than once or twice a year. Oat milk is gentle on the ferrets\u0026rsquo; skin and can relieve itchiness without completely stripping the skin\u0026rsquo;s oils.\nAnother reason ferrets get the reputation of smelling bad comes from a ferret \u0026lsquo;pooting\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;poofing\u0026rsquo;. This is normally a rare occurrence when a ferret is stressed or scared. The smell is like \u0026lsquo;concentrated ferret\u0026rsquo; and can be rather unpleasant. The odour comes directly from the ferret\u0026rsquo;s anal glands. So de-scented ferrets will not experience this. It is not always something that happens from being scared or stressed, though! We have often experienced our hob, Boots, pooting when he is overexcited or playing.\nIn short, ferrets do smell. Although, it\u0026rsquo;s not as bad as people make it out to be. Ferrets should not be bathed and this does not reduce their smell. Most owners actually end up liking the ferret musk!\n","permalink":"https://thatferret.blog/posts/lodeur-du-furet-aka-the-smell/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u0026lsquo;Are ferrets smelly?\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t ferrets stink?\u0026rsquo;.

But where do you get them from?\nWhen looking at getting ferrets there are basically 3 options.\nBreeders Pet Shops Rescues/Shelters. In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll dive into each option to help you decide where to get your ferrets.\nBreeders Ferrets from private and ethical Breeders will normally be younger ferrets (kits). They can be from accidental litters, bred for specific purposes (working or showing), bred as pets (for temperament and home life), or bred for specific markings, colours, or coats (the most common ones bred specifically for this purpose are Angora ferrets). The cost for bred ferrets varies drastically. The cost will depend on the specific breeders\u0026rsquo; fees and often the type and sex of the ferret. Costs can be from £50-£200 per ferret.\nBreeders should have access to the health history of the ferrets and the mum \u0026amp; dad. Ferrets should be properly raised, weaned away from the parents and vaccinated. To sell pets commercially the breeder should be licensed with their local council.\nAnywhere you decide to acquire your ferrets will come with pros and cons. Here are some pros and cons of buying a ferret from Breeders:\nPros Being able to meet the mum \u0026amp; dad and know exactly where the ferrets are from. Access to previous health information about the ferrets. If you\u0026rsquo;d like a kit specifically, buying from a breeder may be a pro. Ability to get 2 ferrets from the same litter. Being able to ask the owners/breeders ferret-related information and questions. Cons Kits are not often ideal for first-time ferret owners. The price may be higher. Dangers of backyard breeding. You will have to purchase 2 ferrets, and although they are from the same litter, they may not necessarily be bonded. As you are getting kits, there will be more expenses, such as Spaying/Neutering in the future. If you\u0026rsquo;re considering getting a pair of ferrets from a breeder it\u0026rsquo;s important to ask questions. I have put together a simple list of questions that you can ask.\nWhat to ask the Breeders. Are we able to see the parents? Have there ever been any health concerns with Mum or Dad, or any of your kits? Why do you breed kits? How regularly are the kits handled? Are they well-established? What are they currently being fed? Have they had initial injections \u0026amp; health checkups? Are they microchipped, and treated for fleas \u0026amp; worms? When purchasing from breeders, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to ask as many questions as possible. You\u0026rsquo;ll want to see the ferrets\u0026rsquo; living conditions and meet the ferrets before you decide to get them. There are many good, ethical breeders around. Unfortunately, like every animal breeding community, there are also potentially dangerous backyard breeders who care more about the money than the ferrets\u0026rsquo; welfare and potential home.\nGood and well-established breeders will genuinely care about their ferrets, the care they provide and the potential homes they will be going to. It is important to keep this in mind when talking to them. Good breeders will ask you as the adopter lots of questions, they may want to know why you would like pet ferrets, what your plans are surrounding their care and ask for photos of your enclosure set up. Don\u0026rsquo;t be defensive — It\u0026rsquo;s not that they are trying to hassle you. It\u0026rsquo;s a good sign that they care. If they don\u0026rsquo;t seem bothered about the ferrets, cannot answer your questions, or the ferrets don\u0026rsquo;t appear in good health. Do not buy from them.\nThe dangers of buying from Breeders/Backyard Breeding. Backyard breeding can produce unhealthy ferrets that are prone to multiple illnesses. These ferrets will not have a good quality of life and can cost £100s-£1000s in vet bills. Supporting Backyard breeding enables the Breeders to continue breeding and selling unhealthy and not well-looked-after ferrets. Backyard breeding can produce ferrets with emotional and behavioural problems, they may be more temperamental and prone to bite. Backyard-bred ferrets often have a shorter lifespan. Pet Shops In the UK, chain pet shops which sell other species of animals (Pets at Home, Jollyes etc) do not sell ferrets. Ferrets are less popular in the UK to keep as animals and are less spoken about. Therefore, there is no current demand for retailers to sell them. There are also a few concerns surrounding selling ferrets in the UK. Such as ferrets\u0026rsquo; common illness\u0026rsquo;, specialised care, dietary needs etc. (Opinion: I think this is utterly ridiculous. We have other exotic animals sold in chain pet shops that require equal special care requirements such as Rats, Reptiles, and even Rabbits \u0026amp; Cavies who come under exotic. Yet for some reason, there\u0026rsquo;s a line drawn at Ferrets? Saying that, I\u0026rsquo;m also happy that pet shops do not supply ferrets as I do not support chains\u0026rsquo; use of unethical rodent mills and other animal mills — which is where all of their animals are sourced).\nIn the US and other countries, it is fairly common to see ferrets at chain pet stores such as Pet Smart. Ferrets sold in these chain shops retail at around $499 (that\u0026rsquo;s around £400) per ferret, and come already vaccinated, neutered/spayed, and descented (descenting is not a requirement).\nSo for all my friends in the US and other countries, I\u0026rsquo;ve put together a Pros and Cons list for buying ferrets in shops. This will be written to the best of my ability, also considering some points that cross over with the UK. I have researched Marshall Ferrets for this piece as it is where ferrets are commonly sourced in the US, and they are considerably similar to rodent mills.\nPros Easily accessible. Are known to be more docile. Typically socialised. Already vaccinated, Spayed/Neutered. (Supposed to be) Health checked before purchase. I struggled to find pros, to be honest, there are not many at all. This was me stretching the list, but the only real pro is that they are easily accessible. That being said, it\u0026rsquo;s not always a good thing that animals are \u0026rsquo;easy to buy'.\nCons Marshall Ferrets. (A post going into more depth will be published in the future when I have deep-dived). Desexed and descended at a young age, causing many health concerns for the future and sometimes stunted growth. Shorter life expectancies due to poor breeding ethics. More prone to diseases and illness\u0026rsquo; meaning you will also have to pay more vet fees in the future. Supplying shops so they can continue funding unethical breeding practices. I would continue, but will make a specific post on shops selling animals in the future. This will be based on Marshall Ferrets as well as rodent and other animal mills in the UK. If you are going to buy a ferret from a shop, make sure you have appropriately researched and considered other alternatives.\nRescues Rescues are situated everywhere. All areas and all countries have animal rescues and shelters. A quick google search will let you find a rescue near you. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to adopt a ferret from a rescue, you can give them a call or fill out a form. They will normally invite you in for a visit to meet the animals, provide you with needed information and help you with your adoption application.\nYou may need to undergo a house inspection or provide pictures of your set-up before adopting ferrets from rescues. This is because they care about the animals\u0026rsquo; welfare and what homes they are going to!\nRescues will take in unwanted, abandoned, or injured animals and make sure they are okay. Any good ferret rescue will work with their ferrets to make sure they are well-adjusted and ready for a new home.\nThis may include:\nTaking the ferrets to a vet. Treating the ferret. Vaccinating, Spaying/Neutering. Temperament checking. Training and socialisation. Bonding the ferrets into pairs or groups if they come in as lone ferrets. All of this should be done before the ferrets are put up for adoption, but it varies from rescue to rescue. You can contact your preferred rescue for any information on their policies and rehoming procedures.\nRescuing ferrets is suited to all types of owners. But it\u0026rsquo;s especially beneficial for new ferrents (ferret parents). As the ferrets are already a bit older than kits. They will be socialised, bite-trained, well-adjusted, vaccinated, and spayed/neutered. The adoption fee or donation varies from rescue to rescue, but it\u0026rsquo;s usually much cheaper than buying ferrets from breeders or pet shops. Here are some potential Pros and Cons for rescuing ferrets.\nPros Ferrets are already bonded, vaccinated, and spayed/neutered, so you\u0026rsquo;ll save yourself time and vet costs. The rescue will be able to answer any questions you may have regarding the ferrets. You will always be able to contact the rescue even after bringing your ferrets home. You will be able to meet the ferrets before adopting. Some rescues also offer ferret \u0026lsquo;matchmaking\u0026rsquo; where they can find the perfect pair of ferrets to suit you, or any additional ferrets should you already have a lone one. You have the ability to help a great cause and help the rescue open space so they can take on more ferrets in need. Cons You often will not be able to find kits or choose specifically the ferrets you want (if you are looking for specific ones). You will not have access to the full history of the ferrets (the rescue would have rescued them, and may be able to tell you some information. But you\u0026rsquo;re unlikely to ever know further details). You may need to continue working with the ferrets. Some ferrets in rescues have behaviour issues, bite issues or are shy due to past neglect. Although the rescue would have helped the ferrets as much as possible, sometimes it is an ongoing commitment. The pros of rescuing far outweigh the cons in my opinion. Personally, rescuing is always my number one recommendation. We adopted our two ferrets, Boots \u0026amp; Toots, and could not be happier.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to read about my personal experience rescuing ferrets.

That also means I frequently spend loads of time researching and using kitchen tools.\nSo here are my top picks for kitchen tools you should consider adding to your arsenal.\nAll the links on this post are not affiliate links.\nThis may change, and if so, will be fully disclosed.\nKenwood Chef Stand Mixer Ok, this one is more of a prerequisite purchase combined with the next item. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the most useful kitchen appliances we own.\nWe had a 7ish year old kMix that gave up the ghost when I decided to try to grind some turkey necks. The mixer, with its attachment, was doing just fine. Then bam! The motor safety engages and locks. Maybe it worked a vertebra into an awkward angle and put too much torque on the motor. Well, I emptied the grinder attachment, cleaned it up, performed the reset procedure on the kMix, and… Nothing. Well, bugger. Suffice it to say, I took it apart and inspected everything, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t identify what had actually gone wrong in its guts. I\u0026rsquo;m not an electrical technician; I do IT.\nI have to add that the mincer attachment very clearly states: \u0026lsquo;Always ensure bones and rind etc are removed from the meat before mincing\u0026rsquo;. So, really, who\u0026rsquo;s to blame?\nAnyway, along comes the Kenwood Chef. From what I can find, it has the same 1000W motor power. But it has a nice extra feature; a high-speed attachment mount. Now, for the purpose of my recommendation here, it\u0026rsquo;s just a meat grinder, and frankly, most of the other purpose-built grinders available are just as great or better for that job, but I hate single-purpose kitchen gadgets. So when you tell me there\u0026rsquo;s a blender attachment and a food processor attachment for it, I just can\u0026rsquo;t resist!\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t tried mincing bones again, yet, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that I even need to try as we now buy minced chicken carcass for the bone content. But I have noticed it seems to be chewing through our monthly grinding a bit easier.\nKenwood Food Mincer Attatchment As said above, this is combined with the stand mixer.\nNow, obviously, the attachment is specific to the stand mixer we have, but the principle is that you need a good food mincer/meat grinder.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s not that much I can say about the attachment though, it\u0026rsquo;s just a good, solid, cast aluminium housing with a stainless steel blade and screens. It comes with other bits for making sausages and such, but who cares? I\u0026rsquo;m shoving lamb testicles through it.\nThere are other mincers, and with the lightest bit of research, you can\u0026rsquo;t really go wrong (unless you want to grind bones).\nPoultry Shears These things are essential if you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with small, soft bones.\nMaybe you want to portion some smaller bits of a chicken wing for the ferrets, or you\u0026rsquo;re just spatchcocking a chicken. I can\u0026rsquo;t live without them.\nMy choice here isn\u0026rsquo;t really based on much. But this pair comes apart for easy cleaning, and personally, I like the handle design (Bunny\u0026rsquo;s hands are too small to use them effectively).\nCould I have bought a cheaper pair? Yes.\nCould I have bought a better pair? Possibly.\nBut I like these poultry shears.\nTupperware, no not the brand Tupperware is a company that makes kitchen storage containers, but the word tupperware has been genericised to mean kitchen storage containers.\nSo we\u0026rsquo;ve minced up all our meat and offal. Where do we put it?\nYup, tupperware!\nYou need to make sure it\u0026rsquo;s dishwasher-safe (do you really want to handwash them?), freezer-safe, airtight, and preferably fastened with a clip on all sides; we don\u0026rsquo;t want to be spilling raw meat all over the floor.\nWe just grabbed some from Tesco (Klipfresh), they had a good clubcard deal on. They seal nicely, look good, and come in a variety of sizes.\nCutting board No link for this one, it\u0026rsquo;s a cutting board, and it\u0026rsquo;s a personal affair. You know what it\u0026rsquo;s for, you know why you should have one.\nWhat I will say is that you want a sturdy one, preferably with feet. You\u0026rsquo;re probably going to be hacking apart organs and meat on it, so you\u0026rsquo;ll want to maintain it and look after it. And I can\u0026rsquo;t think of a better way to encourage that than getting one you really like, or maybe one that\u0026rsquo;s a little more pricey than you\u0026rsquo;d otherwise buy, it\u0026rsquo;s a good excuse ;) (still purchase within your means, though!).\nBelow is a great video by Jose.elcook showing cutting board seasoning.\nNote:\nBe careful when exposing a cutting board to a lot of water, it will soak it up which expands the cellulose fibres, and when it dries it will contract. If this happens unevenly it will warp and can crack.\nJose shows the use of pure mineral oil, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend against that and use a beeswax and tung or mineral oil blend.\nThe tung/mineral oil provides a deep, penetrating hydration that blocks the absorption of whatever you\u0026rsquo;re cutting, and the beeswax seals the grain and creates a pliable coat that can repair itself after you hack at it with a knife.\n","permalink":"https://thatferret.blog/posts/jacks-top-kitchen-picks/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe spend plenty of time making food for our animals, raw food for our ferrets and our dog, and veg for our bearded dragons.

The more space you can offer, the better! Consider where your ferrets will live — maybe in their own room, sharing a living space with you, or being outside in the warmer months.\nIndoor cages Indoor cages offer your ferret a place of warmth and safety. Cages should be big enough to allow the ferrets to fully stretch out from the tip of the nose to the tip of the tail. Double cages are very popular within the ferret community as they allow ample room for up to 4 ferrets. Here are a few suitable and popular cages:\nMidwest/Critter Nation Cage The Critter Nation Cage (or CNC) is a cage often raved about in the ferret community. Unfortunately, it can be hard to source within the UK and is more readily available in the US and other countries. Unfortunately, I have no personal experience with this cage. But from what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen and heard, it is great! The Critter Nation can be around $200-300 (that\u0026rsquo;s £160-240ish).\nMore information and where to get a Critter Nation Cage can be found at critternationcage.com\nPet Planet Cage The Pet Planet Cage (or PPC) is known to be a decently suited cage among the ferret and rat community. The PPC retails for around £250, but there are always sales on, so 9/10 times you can snag the cage for around £150-200. The dimensions for the Pet Planet are W96 x D63 x H159 cm (including the stand), meaning there is plenty of room for your ferrets to sleep and do their ferret business.\nHaving personally owned the Pet Planet Cage for around a year, I will say it is a decently suited cage. I have put together a pros and cons list based on my experiences with the PPC:\nPros:\nGood amount of space with additional levels.\nLarge bar spacing for visibility and airflow.\nThe cage is made from durable \u0026amp; Long lasting material.\nWide opening doors allow it to be easily accessible and cleanable.\nEasy assembly.\nCons:\nThe levels can be considered rather small and the ladders Steep.\nThe lock mechanism is a sliding lock, meaning smart ferrets may learn to open it from the inside.\nOpinion: It feels rather flimsy and cheap compared to other cages I\u0026rsquo;ve used. The levels and dividers feel almost thin, and the cage framing feels rather light.\nYou can read more about the Pet Planet Cage \u0026amp; Purchase one from petplanet.co.uk\nLittle Zoo Venturer Cage I am biased towards the Little Zoo Venturer Cage (or LZV). I have owned at least one for many years and have used it to house ferrets and rats. However, the quality comes with an additional high price point. The LZV retails at £340.\nSo for the high price point, how does the LZV compare against its competitor cage brands?\nHere are a few keynotes:\nThe LZV measures W93 x D68 x H158cm, so the Width and Depth are around the same as the PPC. However, the LZV does not come on a stand, so the Height of 158 cm is significantly taller.\nThe LZV levels (bottom base, middle base and platforms) are thick, deep, and sturdy.\nThe LZV has held up for many years with no rust or damage (from personal experiences).\nThe lock mechanisms are much more efficient and safe (there is less chance of escape).\nThese are just a few key points about how the LZV compares against other cages. It also has all the same pros as the Pet Planet Cage. The only controversial pro/con with the LZV is bar spacing. The bar spacing for the LZV is 2 mm and significantly smaller than the bar spacing of other similar cages. This could be considered a positive as it means there is less chance of injury and the ferrets getting their head stuck between the bars. But, it can also be seen as a negative as it means hanging hammocks, attachable food bowls etc — ones that are the appropriate size for ferrets — tricky.\nYou can read more about the Little Zoo Venturer Cage \u0026amp; Purchase one from mydegu.com\nFree roam space Ferrets need a suitable environment as well as a suitable cage. Ferrets should be allowed at least 4 hours of free roam time a day. This allows them to run, play and burn off energy. You will find that free roam time may vary from ferret to ferret or seasonally.\nThere are no specifics to the amount of free roam space to give your ferret. However, the more you can offer, the better. If you do not have any suitable space to offer free roam, you could look at different alternatives such as setting up a playpen/play area.\nFerrets can free roam where it is safe to do so. If you have a ferret room or are letting your ferret free roam around your house, you must take safety precautions. This is also known as \u0026lsquo;ferret proofing\u0026rsquo;. Imagine a ferret as a toddler with a knife. If they can find a way to escape or injure themselves — they will! Make sure the area is secure and safe before allowing ferrets to free roam.\nOutdoor accommodation Some people may opt to keep their ferrets outside or take their ferrets outside in the warmer months. Hutches (the ones often sold for rabbits or guinea pigs) are NOT suitable for ferrets to live outdoors. Hutches are made from wood, so will splinter easily if the ferrets decide to chew them. This could also result in the ferrets ingesting the wood. Alongside this, hutches are notorious for being very unstable, and many ferrets find ways to escape them, they frequently do not provide enough vertical space for your ferret to stretch out in and offer little-no climbing or exploring opportunities.\nInstead of hutches, consider a ferret-adjusted outside aviary or a converted ferret-safe shed. These options allow much more room for the ferret and are much safer alternatives to a hutch.\nOutdoor ferret enclosure example Litter trays \u0026amp; Litter Ferrets can easily be litter-trained! Ferrets like to poo in corners and don\u0026rsquo;t often poo in their sleeping areas — they are very clean poo-ers. This means inside their cage you can have 1/2 litter boxes and one for every corner in the free roam area. If you do not want to constantly handle changing litter boxes or litter. You can opt to place down absorbent puppy training pads instead.\nPuppy training pads should not be used for destructive ferrets, in case they\u0026rsquo;re eaten or ingested.\nLitter boxes Litter boxes should be big enough for the ferrets to turn fully. Imagine your ferret standing in the litter box doing a 360° spin. If they can do that easily without falling or knocking the litter tray, then it is big enough. Cat litter trays are typically recommended as they are big. You can get specific corner cat litter boxes if you\u0026rsquo;d prefer. \u0026lsquo;Small pet corner litter boxes\u0026rsquo; marketed towards rats, guinea pigs and rabbits are often too small.\nMost litter boxes can be found in pet stores or online and range from £10-30. Here are 2 of my litter box favourites:\nHigh-sided rectangle litter box, costs £20. Amazon link\nXl corner litter box, costs around £16. Amazon link\nFor a cheap alternative, you could also DIY a litter box! All you would need is a plastic bin/tub which you can cut a shallow entrance into. Make sure you sand the sharp edges down and then add your litter as required.\nHere is a YouTube video on creating a DIY ferret litter box Litter You\u0026rsquo;ll want to avoid all types of crystallised cat litter, litter that clumps, dusty litter, and wood litter which turns into shavings after soiling. You will want paper-based litter as it is often less dusty, meaning it will not cause respiratory problems and is not fatal or harmful if accidentally ingested.\nThe price of paper litter depends on how much you get and where you get it from. It is usually around £6-30. Paper litter is readily available at supermarkets, pet shops or available online. Some supermarkets, such as Tesco\u0026rsquo;s, also do their own paper-based litter, which is £5 for 10L.\nSome paper litter examples:\nBio Catolet Litter is around £6-16 but can vary from where you purchase it. You can read about Bio Catolet and find suitable stockists on biocatolet.co.uk\nBack 2 Nature Litter is around £15-25 but can vary from where you purchase it from. You can read about Back 2 Nature and find suitable stockists on fibrecycle.co.uk\nBreeder Celect Litter is around £9-25 but can vary from where you purchase it. You can read about Breeder Celect and find suitable stockists on breedercelectcats.co.uk\nBeds \u0026amp; Bedding Ferrets sleep for about 14–18 hours daily, so ample bedding and beds should be offered to keep them cosy. A go-to bedding option is blankets! Ferrets love wrapping themselves up or sleeping under blankets. You should also offer them a few different types of beds to lie around in, these could be flat beds, pillow beds, cosy cup beds, or hammocks. Even old clothes such as tee shirts or coats make a great ferret bed.\nMany small businesses make hammocks and small animal beds on Etsy or Facebook. You can search for them or ask ferret groups for opinions. This way you\u0026rsquo;re supporting a small business and spoiling your ferrets. My favourite place to buy ferret hammocks is a small creator on Facebook called \u0026lsquo;Zoes Creature Comforts\u0026rsquo;. She has made all my hammocks for my pet rats and ferrets for a few years.\nAdditionally, if you sew yourself you can have a go at making your own ferret beds and bedding.\nToys \u0026amp; Enrichment When they\u0026rsquo;re awake — ferrets are a huge bundle of chaos and energy! It is important to offer lots of toys and enrichment for your ferrets so they don\u0026rsquo;t get bored. You can rotate their enrichment so they always have different things readily available. Toys and enrichment can be bought, thrifted or DIYed, so no matter what your budget is — you can always provide your ferret with new things to play with and explore.\nBoots \u0026amp; Toots Favourites Our ferrets, B\u0026amp;T, are very energetic and chaotic. When they\u0026rsquo;re awake they want to explore and play with everything! Ferrets\u0026rsquo; favourite toys can differ depending on the individual ferret and their style of play.\nToots likes to stash things, so my go-to options for her are small teddies and toys that she can pick up, run with, and stash. You can use small dog/ puppy toys, cat toys, baby toys and blankets, or you could go to your local charity shops and raid the teddy bins. Anything small that she can squash under her cage is a winner.\nBoots is a troublemaker. He\u0026rsquo;s a younger more bouncy hob who loves to cause havoc. Boots prefers toys like crinkle tunnels to run through, cat wands to chase, and places to dig. Some of his favourites are baby stacking cups, cat crinkle tunnels, ball pit balls, his rice dig box, and plastic slinkies.\nShared favourites As well as toys that you can use to play with your ferrets. You should also consider toys that they would like to play with together or enriching activities they can do on their own. Out of all of their toys, B\u0026amp;T love dust extraction tubes the most. These are long flexible tubes that the ferrets can run through, chase each other in and play with. It is a staple to any ferret room. I say dust extraction tubes specifically as they are much cheaper and come in many lengths and sizes compared to the long flexi tubes found at pet stores. Another favourite would be their cat exercise wheel. Cat wheels are great for helping ferrets maintain a healthy weight and burn off energy. They are also 100% ferret-friendly, as they are large enough for them to run in without worries of spine curvature.\nBoth our flexi tubes and our cat wheel are from eBay. They are a bit of an expensive purchase, but we highly recommend checking them out.\nLinked below:\nDust extradtion tubes: eBay link\nCat Wheel: eBay link\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to see our cat wheel in action or cute videos and pictures of Boots \u0026amp; Toots, make sure to follow them on Instagram. You can find the profile in my Linktree.\nDIY Toys \u0026amp; Enrichment Ferrets are fascinated by things great and small. If you find yourself on a tight budget, you could try DIYing some ferret toys instead of buying them! The most commonly made and cheap ferret toys are dig boxes. Dig boxes are great because they are inexpensive and offer your ferret the opportunity to dig (potentially saving your carpets). There are plenty of things you can put in dig boxes to offer a great variety of textures. Dig boxes can be plastic tubs filled with uncooked rice, macaroni, puzzle pieces, ping pong balls, scrunched-up paper, bubble wrap etc.\nSome other things you could do are make sock toys, cardboard box forts, paper bags with holes in or use an array of cheap everyday objects, which can be used as ferret toys. Things like canvas bags, baby play mats, pop-up tents, etc.\nToys \u0026amp; Enrichment Videos.\nHere are a few YouTube links to videos about ferret toys and enrichment.\n\u0026lsquo;Weird items to use with ferrets\u0026rsquo;. This video highlights everyday things, toys, and enrichment you can make or use for your ferrets. \u0026lsquo;Top 10 ferret toys\u0026rsquo;. Food Kibble can be sourced from most pet retailers or online. Raw food can be sourced from some pet shops, and retailers, but mostly online depending on what raw you\u0026rsquo;d like to go with. If you are modifying 80/10/10 or using premixed or pre-ground raw, this will be available in most pet shops which sell frozen pet supplies such as Jollyes, Scampers and Pets at Home. If you are mixing and chopping the raw yourself and need whole organs or chunks of meat, then you will need more specialised butchers or online sites. If feeding whole prey that you do not source yourself other than some commercial shops which may sell mice and chick\u0026rsquo;s you will have to also source it online.\nHere are a few websites where you can source raw food. (Please note: Do not attempt to feed your ferrets raw before you have done the appropriate raw diet research).\nRaw Pet Supplies is our personal go-to. They offer all categories, such as whole prey, pre-mixed grounds, pre-minced raw, whole organs, chunks, and treats.\nRaw Dog Foods offers 80/10/10, minces, and raw-based treats.\nThe raw pet store provides a variety of everything.\nImportant: you will want to make sure when looking for raw (specifically if it is pre-mixed, 80/10/10 or pre-minced), that there are no hidden or added vegetables. Since raw feeding is mostly common among dogs (because they are one of the most common pets) a lot of pre-mixed raw contains vegetables suitable for dogs. Ferrets cannot eat and digest vegetables and need a 100% meat-based diet. I recommend Raw Pet Supplies as it will also let you shop by animal, meaning you can categorise ferrets and shop based on things suitable for them.\nVisit the Holistic Ferret Forum for raw feeding advice and guidelines. The link to the website is in my Linktree.\nOn top of raw supplies, you will have to think about raw preparation supplies and kitchen essentials, especially if you are mincing your own meat and mixing it yourself. This would consist of scales, bone shears, a grinder, a food processor, etc.\nJack\u0026rsquo;s Top Kitchen Tools\nMy partner, the blog developer and fellow mustelid enthusiast, is in charge of ordering raw supplies and kitchen gadgets. He has spent a significant amount of time researching grinders and bone shears etc. And these are his top picks.\nWant to make sure you have everything ready for your ferrets?\nI have made a handy checklist of all the basic essentials!\n","permalink":"https://thatferret.blog/posts/ferret-supplies-and-basics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis post will go more in-depth regarding ferret supplies!

This will cover all the basics needed before you bring your ferrets home. The ferrets themselves. This will be how much the ferrets are to purchase or adopt. Ongoing costs. This will cover all maintenance and replenishing costs such as food, litter, and other supplies. Veterinary care costs. Initial Ferret Supplies You\u0026rsquo;ll want to cover the essentials before you consider bringing the ferrets home. This would require a start-up cost and include things such as a cage for your ferrets, suitable bedding, litter trays, litter (or puppy pads), bowls (bottles are not recommended), a carrier, toys/enrichment, and I highly recommend setting up a ferret emergency kit. The cost for these things varies depending on what items you buy and where you get the items from. But expect a few hundred to be spent.\nI have written a basic ferret supplies checklist, which can be found here.\nI have also written a post about my favourite supplies and where to source them, which is here — please note this is specific to the UK. Similar items may be available in the US and other countries.\nThe Ferrets Themselves Another cost to consider would be the initial cost of purchasing or adopting the ferrets. This would depend on where you are from and where you get the ferrets. Adopting or rescuing a pair of ferrets may cost less and require a small donation or adoption fee. Whereas ferrets brought from a breeder or pet shop may cost a lot more.\nTypically, adopting a pair of ferrets can range anywhere from £20-£50 per ferret. If buying from an established private breeder, it can range from £50-100 per ferret. In the UK ferrets are not sold in pet shops but as an example: within the US, if buying a ferret from a pet shop you\u0026rsquo;re looking at around $499 per ferret (that\u0026rsquo;s about £395). So as you can tell, the initial cost for the ferrets is substantially different.\nOngoing Costs The ongoing cost for ferrets is pretty minimal. But (you\u0026rsquo;ve guessed it) — it varies! You will want to replenish food supplies, litter (or puppy pads) and enrichment.\nFood costs would depend on what diet you are feeding your ferrets (kibble, raw, 80/10/10, whole prey etc.), and on how much you are feeding your ferrets/how quickly the food is likely to run out and needs to be restocked. Additionally, you may also factor in the cost of appropriate food-related equipment, such as storage containers or meat preparation equipment.\nLitter or puppy pads will need to be bought as/when you run out of them. It will depend on which one you use, how often you clean the litter area, and what size bags of litter or pads you buy. I buy around 5 bags of litter per month, the bags are 10l each, and that covers my ferrets\u0026rsquo; litter boxes, which I clean once every 2 days or as/when it is needed. I have only brought 2 packs (x50 in a pack) of puppy pads which have lasted over 5 months with leftovers, this is because I only put puppy pads in the corners of the ferrets\u0026rsquo; room and throw them away if an accident should occur.\nLastly, toys and enrichment. This cost would depend on what you get and where from, if items need to be replaced and your spending habits (I know I spend way too much on spoiling my babies). Toys and enrichment can often be DIY-ed, but you would still need to take into account the cost of materials. Enrichment, for ferrets specifically, could be as easy as a paper bag or tub full of uncooked rice. As long as your toys and enrichment activities are rotated to provide endless entertainment for your ferrets and prevent boredom — they are happy with anything! Toys should be thrown out and replaced if broken, worn down or damaged.\nVeterinary Care Costs Ferrets are considered exotic animals and their veterinary fees are rather substantial. They are probably the most hefty cost to consider in the long term. If you live in the US, ferrets will usually be Marshall ferrets, which means they are already vaccinated and spayed/neutered. But in the UK (unless you adopt) ferrets will need to be spayed/neutered and vaccinated which can be quite costly. It is also a good idea to get your ferrets microchipped and checked over by the vet at least once a year for a general check-up and to rule out any health concerns. Spay/neuter costs are around £100-£200 per ferret, vaccinations can range from £50-75 and checkups £50-100.\nThe real cost occurs as your ferret ages. Ferrets are prone to several illnesses, many of which need ongoing care provided by a vet. This can easily cost £100s-£1000s in vet bills per ferret! This excludes any accidents or emergency vet trips!\nIt is important that your ferret is insured or that you are putting money aside for vet care in case it\u0026rsquo;s needed.\nPersonal Cost Breakdown My personal start-up cost for my pair of ferrets was around £700ish. This included their cage, toys/enrichment, bedding, initial food, grooming supplies, treats, and the ferrets. We adopted our ferrets from a rescue so they were already vaccinated, neutered, and spayed, meaning there were no additional costs. We spend around £25 a month on litter replenishment, £45 on raw food supplies, and £20ish a month on the odd toys. This list breakdown doesn\u0026rsquo;t include random, small, purchases like additional toys or blankets. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t include random big purchases like a cat wheel or stand mixer with food processor attachments (for raw food prep). And lastly, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t include pet insurance, which we have yet to get.\nTo conclude, ferrets are very costly. But are they worth it? In my opinion, yes, absolutely!

This would require a start-up cost and include things such as a cage for your ferrets, suitable bedding, litter trays, litter (or puppy pads), bowls (bottles are not recommended), a carrier, toys/enrichment, and I highly recommend setting up a ferret emergency kit. The cost for these things varies depending on what items you buy and where you get the items from. But expect a few hundred to be spent.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"How Much Do Ferrets Cost?"},{"content":"Someone asked, \u0026lsquo;What are the pros and cons of owning ferrets? Would they make good starter pets?\u0026rsquo;.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a little list I put together.\nPros: Highly social and playful animals that will keep you laughing for hours! They\u0026rsquo;re interesting \u0026amp; exciting. Build strong bonds with owners and make good companionship. Relatively easy \u0026amp; enjoyable to care for once you have researched and are in a routine compared to other exotic animals (Y\u0026rsquo;all don\u0026rsquo;t come for me. This is not to say they are easy pets - but they are easier/more enjoyable than some other exotic animals - based on my experiences). They can be cuddly and affectionate (some are not). Very intelligent and can be trained, making them versatile (litter box trained, harness \u0026amp; lead trained, etc.). Help with routine and stability. Can benefit your MH \u0026amp; reduce anxiety/stress. Cons: Expensive. Very expensive. This includes start-up costs, general upkeep, replenishing stock (toys, litter, bedding, food, enrichment), and vet care. Vet care (as a separate con) because not only is it expensive but you\u0026rsquo;ll have to source an exotic specialist vet. Depending on where you\u0026rsquo;re from (or where the ferrets are from) you\u0026rsquo;ll also have to account for spaying/neutering, microchipping, injections etc. Health \u0026amp; Research. Also, depending on where you are, there\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of research on domesticated ferrets. They\u0026rsquo;re also prone to a lot of illnesses with age or genetics. Specialist diet. They\u0026rsquo;re obligate carnivores, so you need to do a lot of food research. The best diet for them is raw; depending on how you choose to do your raw, it can be costly, time-consuming (for preparation), and quite tedious sometimes. Space \u0026amp; Free roam. They need a large cage — saying this, they are not caged animals and will need multiple hours of free roam a day. This takes up a lot of your time, and you also need to spend additional time ferret-proofing everywhere they roam. Biting. Ferrets can and will bite; it\u0026rsquo;s how they communicate and initiate play. They will have to be bite-trained, but you will still get the occasional nip — meaning they won\u0026rsquo;t be a great option if you\u0026rsquo;re overly sensitive to roughhousing. General maintenance. Grooming, nail clips, and general things you will have to do (could be considered a con for some people). I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend ferrets as a starter pet at all. They\u0026rsquo;re highly complex exotic animals. Out of all the animals I\u0026rsquo;ve rescued and personally owned, I\u0026rsquo;d say they\u0026rsquo;re in the top 3 of being high maintenance. But if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to put in the time, effort, and dedication to owning them, they will make absolutely wonderful pets and bring you so much joy!\n","permalink":"https://thatferret.blog/posts/potential-pros-and-cons-of-owning-ferrets/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSomeone asked, \u0026lsquo;What are the pros and cons of owning ferrets?
