This does not mean you constantly need to buy a surplus of toys (although it can be tempting). But instead, keep some toys aside and switch them out. Making their play area new, fun and exciting!\nIn this post, I will highlight some ideas for ferret toys and enrichment activities.\nBefore listing some enrichment and toys, it’s essential to define what makes them good. “What makes this toy good for my ferrets?”. Well, to put it simply, good toys will:\nPromote or encourage natural behaviours. Provide stimulation. Be ferret-suitable AND safe. Here are the main categories of ferret toys. You may notice some overlap between specific categories. To avoid repeating the same toys multiple times, I have put them into categories that best apply.\nTunnels \u0026 Tubes Tunnels and tubes are universally known to be some of the best toys for ferrets. They come in many shapes, diameters and lengths, offering interchangeability and hours of ferret dooking fun!\nPlastic Tunnels There are many types of plastic tunnels. Often, you will see them marketed as small pet tunnels in pet shops and online. They are usually bright colours and come in different sizes and lengths. They will usually be corrugated, and you can push or pull them to expand the length of the tunnel.\nHere are some linked examples:\nhttps://www.rabbit-world.com/product/rabbit-tunnel-in-plastic\nhttps://littlehayco.com/products/bunny-warren-tunnel\nhttps://amzn.eu/d/9VAjfOp\nDust extraction tubes Dust extraction tubes are similar to the ones mentioned above, BUT they’re much cheaper. You can get them in different diameters and a wider range of sizes.\nThey’re made from soft plastic with a metal coil insert, making them durable and flexible. They are of much higher quality and long-lasting.\nYou can put these tubes on the floor, knot them into fun shapes, wrap them around cages and mount them onto walls.\nI recommend a few dust extraction tubes as a staple to any ferret space. They are one of our ferrets’ favourite toys. They offer hours of endless running, chasing, and playing games.\nHere are some linked examples:\nhttps://www.diy.com/departments/axminster-clear-lightweight-pvc-extraction-hose-100mm-x-1m/5052511110209_BQ.prd\nhttps://ebay.us/m/cTQhkJ\nOur ferrets (Loot, Fruit, and Newt) playing in dust extraction tube\nCrinkle tunnels Another brilliant addition to any ferret space is crinkle tunnels. They are often marketed towards cats and typically made from a thin plastic material or fabric with a crinkly plastic insert.\nCrinkle tunnels will flat pack for easy storage, making them an ideal option for rotation. We have four crinkle tunnels in our ferret room. We rotate two at a time so our ferrets never get bored with them.\nMost ferrets will love all toys that crinkle!\nHere are some linked examples:\nhttps://www.petsathome.com/product/crinkle-play-tunnel-cat-toy/7112980P\nhttps://www.bmstores.co.uk/products/cat-play-tunnel-grey-3143271\nhttps://amzn.eu/d/cOxJ0uM\nTunnels with multiple entrances/exits These are usually similar to crinkle tunnels in the way they flat pack. But some do not come with the crinkle feature.\nYou may be wondering, “But all tunnels technically have multiple entrances/exits” Well, these tunnels have additional holes running throughout the main body, which is an excellent feature for ferrets that love chase games, running through and jumping out at you (pop goes the ferret).\nThese tunnels are also a good option for shy ferrets, who feel the need to be close to an exit at all times, or groups of ferrets who will often bundle in one tunnel.\nHere are some linked examples:\nhttps://amzn.eu/d/jho5joo\nhttps://amzn.eu/d/a2GjJOj\nhttps://amzn.eu/d/cewnxUl\nFabric Tunnels These tunnels are exactly as they sound: tunnels made solely of fabric. They’re usually flatter tunnels that ferrets have to crawl into instead of running through. They’re a good addition to smaller spaces or inside cages, as they have the added feature of being snuggly, meaning most ferrets will also use them as a bed.\nDig boxes Dig boxes are a great enrichment activity. They promote the ferrets’ natural behaviour to dig and offer bountiful stimulation opportunities.\nYou can easily make a dig box by getting a large plastic storage container and filling it with one of the following:\nUncooked long-grain rice Uncooked rice is one of the most common things ferrents fill their dig boxes with. Most ferrets will not associate rice with litter, so you won’t have to worry about them using it as a litter spot (although it can happen).\nRice is relatively small, making it a good digging material. Ferrets will scratch, dig, roll around, and submerge themselves in the rice.\nIt also has the added benefit of absorbing smells and being easy to hoover up in times of spillage.\nMake sure your ferrets are not attempting to consume the rice. It is uncommon but not unheard of. If your ferrets are eating the rice, remove it and replace it with something else.\nUncooked macaroni This one is the most common. I’m sure we have all seen the TikTok videos of ferrets plunging into a box full of uncooked macaroni.\nWhy is it specifically macaroni and not other types of pasta? Well, it’s due to the shape of macaroni. It’s often smooth and rounded, allowing ferrets to dig, play, and tumble in it without harm.\nAlways stick with macaroni if you plan to use uncooked pasta in your dig box! Other shapes, such as fusilli, farfalle, or penne, often have sharp edges, openings, or points, which can cause your ferrets to injure themselves.\nSimilar to the rice, ensure your ferrets are not trying to consume the macaroni; if they are, remove it immediately.\nTopsoil Topsoil is an excellent material to use in a dig box and a more natural option.\nThe soil is soft on the ferrets’ feet; it can easily hold some form and provides extra texture stimulation. Topsoil is a messier option and may end up covering your ferret. However, it’s brushed off easily enough and it’s also easily hoovered up if a spillage occurs.\nThe downside to topsoil is that you’ll have to monitor it closely. Any moisture added to the soil (e.g. if the ferrets were to urinate in it) can lead to mould growth.\nIf you notice mould growth in your topsoil, remove it immediately and thoroughly clean the area.\nShredded paper/paper packaging A cheaper and easier option is to fill a dig box with shredded paper. You usually end up with a pile of shredded paper or paper packaging after a cheeky online shopping spree, so why not put it to good use?\nFerrets will love the added sound of digging in paper, as it produces a soft crinkle noise.\nShredded paper/paper packaging is one of the more eco-friendly and less wasteful alternatives, as it can be upcycled and recycled.\nDissolvable (starch) packing peanuts Again, you usually end up with these after a cheeky shopping spree.\nI specify starch packing peanuts for their dissolvable qualities, unlike polystyrene (which can be harmful if ingested and breaks down into tiny pieces). Starch packing peanuts dissolve when in contact with water or saliva.\nIt’s still not ideal for ferrets to be ingesting starch. But it is better than ending up with a potentially fatal blockage. I still recommend replacing the starch peanuts with something else if you see your ferrets attempting to eat them.\nStarch peanuts are also less dense, meaning that when you plop your ferret in the dig box, they’ll usually sink to the bottom (not a practical point, but it’s amusing to watch them dook and jump around after!)\nYou can change the contents of a dig box as/when needed. Providing extra stimulation and reducing boredom.\nDepending on what you fill the dig box with, it may be pretty heavy, so the ferrets will not be able to move it; a bonus if you have corners you want to stop your ferrets from pooping in or specific areas of your ferret space you want to protect (edges of carpet, for example).\nHere is a video example of some ferret dig box ideas! (Including some additional materials I have not mentioned).\nStashing toys Stashing is another natural behaviour for ferrets. Some ferrets are keen stashers, whereas others are not as interested.\nIf you have a stash ferret, it’s essential to provide them with some suitable toys to encourage this natural behaviour. There’s nothing cuter than watching a ferret run off with a toy, trying not to trip over on the way to their secret stash spot.\nThe most common stashing toys are:\nSmall teddies Small teddies are a great way to build up a stash-toy collection. They are easily accessible and can be cheap.\nYou can find small teddies just about anywhere - in supermarkets, shops, online and thrift stores.\nOne of my girls’ favourite things to stash are teeny tiny Squishmallows!\nWhen choosing teddies for your ferrets, it’s essential to ensure they do not have beans inside or have hard, small plastic eyes, noses, etc. These pose a risk if the teddy is split open or broken. This can lead to potential choking or a blockage.\nSmall pet toys Small pet toys, specifically designed for cats or dogs, are another popular option. They come in a range of shapes and sizes, some of which also offer crinkle sounds or different textures.\nSmall pet toys are easily accessible in most pet shops or online.\nThese toys do not pose any risks associated with bean filling, as they are specifically designed for animals. But they may have specific materials that are not deemed ferret-appropriate, such as rubber. Therefore, it is essential to still inspect small animal toys before giving them to your ferrets.\nWhen I say small animal toys, I am exclusively referring to soft toys! NOT small wooden toys, hay toys or ’edible’ toys made for animals such as rabbits, guinea pigs, or hamsters.\nHere are some linked examples:\nhttps://www.petsathome.com/product/just-for-puppy-squeaky-chloe-caterpillar-long-plush-toy/7146486P\nhttps://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-plush-donut-squeaky-dog-toy/7137001P\nhttps://amzn.eu/d/f70rt0q\nOur ferret (Boots) relaxing with a crinkle toy Cat toys that are ferret-suitable Many cat toys are safe for ferrets, including small soft toys and tunnels (as mentioned above). A few other cat toys you can buy for your ferret are:\nCat wands Cat wands are great interactive toys for ferrets. And offer the opportunity for you to be involved and play. Most ferrets love chasing and catching cat wands.\nCat wands are also a good alternative for ferrets that may need redirection or ferrets that you cannot play with hands-on fashion (shy or aggressive ferrets), as you’re able to interact with them from a distance.\nMost cat wands are suitable, except for those which include feathers. Never leave your cat wands on the floor, unattended in your ferret space, or dangling from places. This poses a safety risk, as your ferrets can become entangled in them.\nHere are some linked examples:\nhttps://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-kitten-jellyfish-teaser-toy/7149629P\nhttps://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-leopard-print-cat-teaser-toy/7143662P\nOur ferret (Loot) playing with a cat wand\nCat trees Cat trees provide an excellent opportunity for ferrets to climb and explore. It’s important when looking for cat trees that you pick one suitably sized (not too high) and with enough levels that your ferrets may freely climb and get down from it.\nCat trees come in a variety of shapes and sizes and include different elements such as tunnels, beds, hanging toys, and nooks that offer your ferrets plenty of stimulation.\nYou can find lots of different styles of cat trees in pet stores, online or second-hand. All come with varying prices to suit your budget.\nHere are some linked examples:\nhttps://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/325089255/?icid=ghsandapp_ghs_pdp_share\nhttps://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-gizmo-hammock-cat-tower-grey/7150490P\nhttps://ebay.us/m/KSKTOx\nCat wheels These are an expensive option, but are 100% worth it. Cat wheels offer ferrets the opportunity to run as fast as they’d like with no limitations. It’s a great way for feisty ferrets to burn off some energy while promoting physical and mental stimulation.\n6/7 of our ferrets will use our cat wheel. However, some ferrets prefer it over others.\nWhen choosing a cat wheel, opt for the largest size possible. When running, the ferret’s spine should not be curved, and your ferret should not be running at an angle.\nHere is a cat wheel similar to the one we purchased (you can also get plastic cat wheels):\nhttps://ebay.us/m/xry0GA\nOur ferret (Boots) running on a cat wheel\nDog toys that are ferret suitable Also mentioned above, small dog toys make great stashing toys for ferrets.\nBut an often overlooked option which ferrets love is…\nSnuffle mats Snuffle mats are flat mats (usually made of fleece) which feature lots of different flaps, folds and hiding places.\nThese mats promote natural scavenging behaviours in ferrets, as well as offering mental stimulation. You can hide little treats around the snuffle mat and let your ferrets find them.\nOn top of providing an enriching activity. Snuffle mats are a great addition to your ferret space. Providing alternative textures and even slip resistance if you have tiled, lino or wooden flooring.\nHere are some linked examples:\nhttps://snufflesshop.com/collections/snuffle-mats\nhttps://www.jollyes.co.uk/rufus-rosie-connectable-snuffle-mat-interactive-dog-toy.html\nhttps://amzn.eu/d/7FMOucg\nBaby toys that are ferret suitable Baby toys are everywhere! In supermarkets, thrift stores, online, jumble sales, and car boot sales. They’re very accessible and are usually available at affordable prices (provided you purchase them during a sale or second-hand).\nMy favourite baby toy recommendations for ferrets are:\nBall pits Ball pits are simply great. You can get them in a wide range of shapes and sizes to suit your ferret space. Some ball pits will even collapse for easy storage.\nFerrets love digging around in, jumping through, and burying themselves in a ball pit.\nWe have a soft, collapsible ball pit, and our ferrets will usually use this and go under it, too! Chasing each other and playing hide and seek.\nBall pits are often available for a low price on sites such as Vinted or Facebook Marketplace. You can also find them online.\nHere are some linked examples:\nhttps://www.argos.co.uk/product/9485107\nhttps://amzn.eu/d/cq6Vyiw\nBaby mats An overlooked toy for ferrets is baby mats. You may also get similar styled mats made for kittens. But the baby mats come in more variety and are more durable.\nBaby mats are soft mats with two cross-over ‘rails’; these rails often have loops where there will be dangling toys and/or accessories.\nThese are great for ferrets that generally love dangle toys such as cat wands. They often jump on top of the mat or lie on their backs and swat at the toys.\nYou can add an element of customisation to baby mats, too! By adding your own toys or changing the toys around.\nWhen looking at baby mats, there are lots of options. You want to make sure you get a plain, soft mat. Not the ones that need batteries, have hard plastic accessories, or play awful scratchy lullabies.\nHere are some linked examples:\nhttps://www.argos.co.uk/product/7293580\nhttps://amzn.eu/d/afkHYze\nOur ferret (Loot) playing with a palymat Other miscellaneous baby toys Here is a list of a few other baby toys which your ferrets may love:\nStacking cups. Soft crinkle/rattle balls. Rattles. Long, soft baby books. Soft building blocks. Plastic push-down chase toys. Comforters. Stay away from any rubber bath toys, foam toys, small toys that may pose a choking hazard, or toys that require batteries.\nHere are some linked examples:\nStacking cups\nRattle\nBaby books\nOur ferrets (Boots and Toots) relaxing with a baby book\nThings that can be considered ferret toys Sometimes, I’ll buy my ferrets a new toy, and they’ll be more interested in the box it came in or the packaging.\nFerret toys do not have to be costly and drain your credit limit. There are many things that you may have lying around the house that you can use as a ferret toy! Such as:\nCardboard boxes. All different shapes and sizes. Packaging. As long as it is suitable. (Bubble wrap, for example, must be used with supervision). Socks. Make a great stashing object. Paper bags. Ferrets love climbing in them and the crinkle sounds they make. Plastic bags. With supervision! Ping pong balls. And many, many more! I will be writing a blog post soon on some DIY ferret toy ideas using everyday objects!\nUnsafe Toys! Lastly, I would like to discuss unsafe toys that you should avoid. I have touched on this within the categories, but to reiterate. UNSAFE toys are:\nRubber toys (blockage risk). Silicone toys (blockage risk). Vinyl toys (blockage risk). Other soft plastic toys (blockage risk). Toys with beans in (can be toxic and cause illness or blockage). Scented toys (can cause respiratory upset). Toys with hard plastic noses/eyes (can break off and cause choking/blockages). Toys with feathers (can get stuck in their throats and cause blockage). Toys with pompoms (blockage risk). Rope toys (Can catch nails, toes or feet, can fray and be ingested, causing blockages, can get wrapped around teeth or cause irritation in the throat). And that’s it! My top ferret enrichment and toy ideas. I have included links to example items. I have tried to vary the links from supermarkets and general high street stores to pet shops, small businesses and online.\nI hope this blog post has been helpful and inspired you to fill your ferret space with lots of enrichment and play opportunities.\n","wordCount":"2866","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://thatferret.blog/images/thatferretblog-logo.png","datePublished":"2025-08-12T23:08:56+01:00","dateModified":"2025-08-12T23:15:34+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bunny"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://thatferret.blog/posts/enrichment-and-toys/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"That Ferret Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://thatferret.blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://thatferret.blog/ accesskey=h title="That Ferret Blog (Alt + H)">That Ferret Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Making their play area new, fun and exciting!</p><p>In this post, I will highlight some ideas for ferret toys and enrichment activities.</p><p>Before listing some enrichment and toys, it&rsquo;s essential to define what makes them good. &ldquo;What makes <em>this</em> toy good for my ferrets?&rdquo;. Well, to put it simply, good toys will:</p><ul><li>Promote or encourage natural behaviours.</li><li>Provide stimulation.</li><li>Be ferret-suitable AND safe.</li></ul><hr><p>Here are the main categories of ferret toys. You may notice some overlap between specific categories. To avoid repeating the same toys multiple times, I have put them into categories that best apply.</p><h2 id=tunnels--tubes>Tunnels & Tubes<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tunnels--tubes>#</a></h2><p>Tunnels and tubes are universally known to be some of the best toys for ferrets. They come in many shapes, diameters and lengths, offering interchangeability and hours of ferret dooking fun!</p><h3 id=plastic-tunnels>Plastic Tunnels<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#plastic-tunnels>#</a></h3><p>There are many types of plastic tunnels. Often, you will see them marketed as small pet tunnels in pet shops and online. They are usually bright colours and come in different sizes and lengths. They will usually be corrugated, and you can push or pull them to expand the length of the tunnel.</p><p>Here are some linked examples:</p><p><a href=https://www.rabbit-world.com/product/rabbit-tunnel-in-plastic target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://www.rabbit-world.com/product/rabbit-tunnel-in-plastic>https://www.rabbit-world.com/product/rabbit-tunnel-in-plastic</a></p><p><a href=https://littlehayco.com/products/bunny-warren-tunnel target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://littlehayco.com/products/bunny-warren-tunnel>https://littlehayco.com/products/bunny-warren-tunnel</a></p><p><a href=https://amzn.eu/d/9VAjfOp target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://amzn.eu/d/9VAjfOp>https://amzn.eu/d/9VAjfOp</a></p><h3 id=dust-extraction-tubes>Dust extraction tubes<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dust-extraction-tubes>#</a></h3><p>Dust extraction tubes are similar to the ones mentioned above, BUT they&rsquo;re much cheaper. You can get them in different diameters and a wider range of sizes.</p><p>They&rsquo;re made from soft plastic with a metal coil insert, making them durable and flexible. They are of much higher quality and long-lasting.</p><p>You can put these tubes on the floor, knot them into fun shapes, wrap them around cages and mount them onto walls.</p><p>I recommend a few dust extraction tubes as a staple to any ferret space. They are one of our ferrets&rsquo; favourite toys. They offer hours of endless running, chasing, and playing games.</p><p>Here are some linked examples:</p><p><a href=https://www.diy.com/departments/axminster-clear-lightweight-pvc-extraction-hose-100mm-x-1m/5052511110209_BQ.prd target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://www.diy.com/departments/axminster-clear-lightweight-pvc-extraction-hose-100mm-x-1m/5052511110209_BQ.prd>https://www.diy.com/departments/axminster-clear-lightweight-pvc-extraction-hose-100mm-x-1m/5052511110209_BQ.prd</a></p><p><a href=https://ebay.us/m/cTQhkJ target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://ebay.us/m/cTQhkJ>https://ebay.us/m/cTQhkJ</a></p><p>Our ferrets (Loot, Fruit, and Newt) playing in dust extraction tube</p><div style=position:relative;padding-top:56.25%><iframe src="https://iframe.mediadelivery.net/embed/480178/7c99bced-f8ff-40db-9c83-0da4fd02ff06?autoplay=false&loop=false&muted=true&preload=true&responsive=true" loading=lazy style=border:0;position:absolute;top:0;height:100%;width:100% allow=accelerometer;gyroscope;autoplay;encrypted-media;picture-in-picture; allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h3 id=crinkle-tunnels>Crinkle tunnels<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#crinkle-tunnels>#</a></h3><p>Another brilliant addition to any ferret space is crinkle tunnels. They are often marketed towards cats and typically made from a thin plastic material or fabric with a crinkly plastic insert.</p><p>Crinkle tunnels will flat pack for easy storage, making them an ideal option for rotation. We have four crinkle tunnels in our ferret room. We rotate two at a time so our ferrets never get bored with them.</p><p>Most ferrets will love all toys that crinkle!</p><p>Here are some linked examples:</p><p><a href=https://www.petsathome.com/product/crinkle-play-tunnel-cat-toy/7112980P target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://www.petsathome.com/product/crinkle-play-tunnel-cat-toy/7112980P>https://www.petsathome.com/product/crinkle-play-tunnel-cat-toy/7112980P</a></p><p><a href=https://www.bmstores.co.uk/products/cat-play-tunnel-grey-3143271 target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://www.bmstores.co.uk/products/cat-play-tunnel-grey-3143271>https://www.bmstores.co.uk/products/cat-play-tunnel-grey-3143271</a></p><p><a href=https://amzn.eu/d/cOxJ0uM target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://amzn.eu/d/cOxJ0uM>https://amzn.eu/d/cOxJ0uM</a></p><h3 id=tunnels-with-multiple-entrancesexits>Tunnels with multiple entrances/exits<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tunnels-with-multiple-entrancesexits>#</a></h3><p>These are usually similar to crinkle tunnels in the way they flat pack. But some do not come with the crinkle feature.</p><p>You may be wondering, &ldquo;But all tunnels technically have multiple entrances/exits&rdquo; Well, these tunnels have additional holes running throughout the main body, which is an excellent feature for ferrets that love chase games, running through and jumping out at you (<em>pop</em> goes the ferret).</p><p>These tunnels are also a good option for shy ferrets, who feel the need to be close to an exit at all times, or groups of ferrets who will often bundle in one tunnel.</p><p>Here are some linked examples:</p><p><a href=https://amzn.eu/d/jho5joo target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://amzn.eu/d/jho5joo>https://amzn.eu/d/jho5joo</a></p><p><a href=https://amzn.eu/d/a2GjJOj target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://amzn.eu/d/a2GjJOj>https://amzn.eu/d/a2GjJOj</a></p><p><a href=https://amzn.eu/d/cewnxUl target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://amzn.eu/d/cewnxUl>https://amzn.eu/d/cewnxUl</a></p><h3 id=fabric-tunnels>Fabric Tunnels<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fabric-tunnels>#</a></h3><p>These tunnels are exactly as they sound: tunnels made solely of fabric. They&rsquo;re usually flatter tunnels that ferrets have to crawl into instead of running through. They&rsquo;re a good addition to smaller spaces or inside cages, as they have the added feature of being snuggly, meaning most ferrets will also use them as a bed.</p><hr><h2 id=dig-boxes>Dig boxes<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dig-boxes>#</a></h2><p>Dig boxes are a great enrichment activity. They promote the ferrets&rsquo; natural behaviour to dig and offer bountiful stimulation opportunities.</p><p>You can easily make a dig box by getting a large plastic storage container and filling it with one of the following:</p><h3 id=uncooked-long-grain-rice>Uncooked long-grain rice<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#uncooked-long-grain-rice>#</a></h3><p>Uncooked rice is one of the most common things ferrents fill their dig boxes with. Most ferrets will not associate rice with litter, so you won&rsquo;t have to worry about them using it as a litter spot (although it can happen).</p><p>Rice is relatively small, making it a good digging material. Ferrets will scratch, dig, roll around, and submerge themselves in the rice.</p><p>It also has the added benefit of absorbing smells and being easy to hoover up in times of spillage.</p><p>Make sure your ferrets are not attempting to consume the rice. It is uncommon but not unheard of. If your ferrets are eating the rice, remove it and replace it with something else.</p><h3 id=uncooked-macaroni>Uncooked macaroni<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#uncooked-macaroni>#</a></h3><p>This one is the most common. I&rsquo;m sure we have all seen the TikTok videos of ferrets plunging into a box full of uncooked macaroni.</p><p>Why is it specifically macaroni and not other types of pasta? Well, it&rsquo;s due to the shape of macaroni. It&rsquo;s often smooth and rounded, allowing ferrets to dig, play, and tumble in it without harm.</p><p>Always stick with macaroni if you plan to use uncooked pasta in your dig box! Other shapes, such as fusilli, farfalle, or penne, often have sharp edges, openings, or points, which can cause your ferrets to injure themselves.</p><p>Similar to the rice, ensure your ferrets are not trying to consume the macaroni; if they are, remove it immediately.</p><h3 id=topsoil>Topsoil<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#topsoil>#</a></h3><p>Topsoil is an excellent material to use in a dig box and a more natural option.</p><p>The soil is soft on the ferrets&rsquo; feet; it can easily hold some form and provides extra texture stimulation. Topsoil is a messier option and may end up covering your ferret. However, it&rsquo;s brushed off easily enough and it&rsquo;s also easily hoovered up if a spillage occurs.</p><p>The downside to topsoil is that you&rsquo;ll have to monitor it closely. Any moisture added to the soil (e.g. if the ferrets were to urinate in it) can lead to mould growth.</p><p>If you notice mould growth in your topsoil, remove it immediately and thoroughly clean the area.</p><h3 id=shredded-paperpaper-packaging>Shredded paper/paper packaging<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#shredded-paperpaper-packaging>#</a></h3><p>A cheaper and easier option is to fill a dig box with shredded paper. You usually end up with a pile of shredded paper or paper packaging after a cheeky online shopping spree, so why not put it to good use?</p><p>Ferrets will love the added sound of digging in paper, as it produces a soft crinkle noise.</p><p>Shredded paper/paper packaging is one of the more eco-friendly and less wasteful alternatives, as it can be upcycled and recycled.</p><h3 id=dissolvable-starch-packing-peanuts>Dissolvable (starch) packing peanuts<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dissolvable-starch-packing-peanuts>#</a></h3><p>Again, you usually end up with these after a cheeky shopping spree.</p><p>I specify starch packing peanuts for their dissolvable qualities, unlike polystyrene (which can be harmful if ingested and breaks down into tiny pieces). Starch packing peanuts dissolve when in contact with water or saliva.</p><p>It&rsquo;s still not ideal for ferrets to be ingesting starch. But it is better than ending up with a potentially fatal blockage. I still recommend replacing the starch peanuts with something else if you see your ferrets attempting to eat them.</p><p>Starch peanuts are also less dense, meaning that when you plop your ferret in the dig box, they&rsquo;ll usually sink to the bottom (not a practical point, but it&rsquo;s amusing to watch them dook and jump around after!)</p><p>You can change the contents of a dig box as/when needed. Providing extra stimulation and reducing boredom.</p><p>Depending on what you fill the dig box with, it may be pretty heavy, so the ferrets will not be able to move it; a bonus if you have corners you want to stop your ferrets from pooping in or specific areas of your ferret space you want to protect (edges of carpet, for example).</p><p>Here is a video example of some ferret dig box ideas! (Including some additional materials I have not mentioned).</p><p><lite-youtube videoid=SdHG8SReogI nocookie=true></lite-youtube></p><hr><h2 id=stashing-toys>Stashing toys<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#stashing-toys>#</a></h2><p>Stashing is another natural behaviour for ferrets. Some ferrets are keen stashers, whereas others are not as interested.</p><p>If you have a stash ferret, it&rsquo;s essential to provide them with some suitable toys to encourage this natural behaviour. There&rsquo;s nothing cuter than watching a ferret run off with a toy, trying not to trip over on the way to their secret stash spot.</p><p>The most common stashing toys are:</p><h3 id=small-teddies>Small teddies<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#small-teddies>#</a></h3><p>Small teddies are a great way to build up a stash-toy collection. They are easily accessible and can be cheap.</p><p>You can find small teddies just about anywhere - in supermarkets, shops, online and thrift stores.</p><p>One of my girls&rsquo; favourite things to stash are teeny tiny Squishmallows!</p><p>When choosing teddies for your ferrets, it&rsquo;s essential to ensure they do not have beans inside or have hard, small plastic eyes, noses, etc. These pose a risk if the teddy is split open or broken. This can lead to potential choking or a blockage.</p><h3 id=small-pet-toys>Small pet toys<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#small-pet-toys>#</a></h3><p>Small pet toys, specifically designed for cats or dogs, are another popular option. They come in a range of shapes and sizes, some of which also offer crinkle sounds or different textures.</p><p>Small pet toys are easily accessible in most pet shops or online.</p><p>These toys do not pose any risks associated with bean filling, as they are specifically designed for animals. But they may have specific materials that are not deemed ferret-appropriate, such as rubber. Therefore, it is essential to still inspect small animal toys before giving them to your ferrets.</p><p>When I say small animal toys, I am exclusively referring to soft toys! NOT small wooden toys, hay toys or &rsquo;edible&rsquo; toys made for animals such as rabbits, guinea pigs, or hamsters.</p><p>Here are some linked examples:</p><p><a href=https://www.petsathome.com/product/just-for-puppy-squeaky-chloe-caterpillar-long-plush-toy/7146486P target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://www.petsathome.com/product/just-for-puppy-squeaky-chloe-caterpillar-long-plush-toy/7146486P>https://www.petsathome.com/product/just-for-puppy-squeaky-chloe-caterpillar-long-plush-toy/7146486P</a></p><p><a href=https://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-plush-donut-squeaky-dog-toy/7137001P target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-plush-donut-squeaky-dog-toy/7137001P>https://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-plush-donut-squeaky-dog-toy/7137001P</a></p><p><a href=https://amzn.eu/d/f70rt0q target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://amzn.eu/d/f70rt0q>https://amzn.eu/d/f70rt0q</a></p><p>Our ferret (Boots) relaxing with a crinkle toy

A few other cat toys you can buy for your ferret are:</p><h3 id=cat-wands>Cat wands<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cat-wands>#</a></h3><p>Cat wands are great interactive toys for ferrets. And offer the opportunity for you to be involved and play. Most ferrets love chasing and catching cat wands.</p><p>Cat wands are also a good alternative for ferrets that may need redirection or ferrets that you cannot play with hands-on fashion (shy or aggressive ferrets), as you&rsquo;re able to interact with them from a distance.</p><p>Most cat wands are suitable, except for those which include feathers. Never leave your cat wands on the floor, unattended in your ferret space, or dangling from places. This poses a safety risk, as your ferrets can become entangled in them.</p><p>Here are some linked examples:</p><p><a href=https://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-kitten-jellyfish-teaser-toy/7149629P target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-kitten-jellyfish-teaser-toy/7149629P>https://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-kitten-jellyfish-teaser-toy/7149629P</a></p><p><a href=https://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-leopard-print-cat-teaser-toy/7143662P target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-leopard-print-cat-teaser-toy/7143662P>https://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-leopard-print-cat-teaser-toy/7143662P</a></p><p>Our ferret (Loot) playing with a cat wand</p><div style=position:relative;padding-top:56.25%><iframe src="https://iframe.mediadelivery.net/embed/480178/a4c1cd65-da75-4b55-b9f6-34aa168ea057?autoplay=false&loop=false&muted=true&preload=true&responsive=true" loading=lazy style=border:0;position:absolute;top:0;height:100%;width:100% allow=accelerometer;gyroscope;autoplay;encrypted-media;picture-in-picture; allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h3 id=cat-trees>Cat trees<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cat-trees>#</a></h3><p>Cat trees provide an excellent opportunity for ferrets to climb and explore. It&rsquo;s important when looking for cat trees that you pick one suitably sized (not too high) and with enough levels that your ferrets may freely climb and get down from it.</p><p>Cat trees come in a variety of shapes and sizes and include different elements such as tunnels, beds, hanging toys, and nooks that offer your ferrets plenty of stimulation.</p><p>You can find lots of different styles of cat trees in pet stores, online or second-hand. All come with varying prices to suit your budget.</p><p>Here are some linked examples:</p><p><a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/325089255/?icid=ghsandapp_ghs_pdp_share" target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/325089255/?icid=ghsandapp_ghs_pdp_share">https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/325089255/?icid=ghsandapp_ghs_pdp_share</a></p><p><a href=https://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-gizmo-hammock-cat-tower-grey/7150490P target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-gizmo-hammock-cat-tower-grey/7150490P>https://www.petsathome.com/product/pets-at-home-gizmo-hammock-cat-tower-grey/7150490P</a></p><p><a href=https://ebay.us/m/KSKTOx target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://ebay.us/m/KSKTOx>https://ebay.us/m/KSKTOx</a></p><h3 id=cat-wheels>Cat wheels<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cat-wheels>#</a></h3><p>These are an expensive option, but are 100% worth it. Cat wheels offer ferrets the opportunity to run as fast as they&rsquo;d like with no limitations. It&rsquo;s a great way for feisty ferrets to burn off some energy while promoting physical and mental stimulation.</p><p>6/7 of our ferrets will use our cat wheel. However, some ferrets prefer it over others.</p><p>When choosing a cat wheel, opt for the largest size possible. When running, the ferret&rsquo;s spine should not be curved, and your ferret should not be running at an angle.</p><p>Here is a cat wheel similar to the one we purchased (you can also get plastic cat wheels):</p><p><a href=https://ebay.us/m/xry0GA target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://ebay.us/m/xry0GA>https://ebay.us/m/xry0GA</a></p><p>Our ferret (Boots) running on a cat wheel</p><div style=position:relative;padding-top:56.25%><iframe src="https://iframe.mediadelivery.net/embed/480178/27208315-d0bd-4db2-b9b9-8f597033548f?autoplay=false&loop=false&muted=true&preload=true&responsive=true" loading=lazy style=border:0;position:absolute;top:0;height:100%;width:100% allow=accelerometer;gyroscope;autoplay;encrypted-media;picture-in-picture; allowfullscreen></iframe></div><hr><h2 id=dog-toys-that-are-ferret-suitable>Dog toys that are ferret suitable<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dog-toys-that-are-ferret-suitable>#</a></h2><p>Also mentioned above, small dog toys make great stashing toys for ferrets.</p><p>But an often overlooked option which ferrets love is&mldr;</p><h3 id=snuffle-mats>Snuffle mats<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#snuffle-mats>#</a></h3><p>Snuffle mats are flat mats (usually made of fleece) which feature lots of different flaps, folds and hiding places.</p><p>These mats promote natural scavenging behaviours in ferrets, as well as offering mental stimulation. You can hide little treats around the snuffle mat and let your ferrets find them.</p><p>On top of providing an enriching activity. Snuffle mats are a great addition to your ferret space.

You can get them in a wide range of shapes and sizes to suit your ferret space. Some ball pits will even collapse for easy storage.</p><p>Ferrets love digging around in, jumping through, and burying themselves in a ball pit.</p><p>We have a soft, collapsible ball pit, and our ferrets will usually use this and go under it, too! Chasing each other and playing hide and seek.</p><p>Ball pits are often available for a low price on sites such as Vinted or Facebook Marketplace.

You may also get similar styled mats made for kittens. But the baby mats come in more variety and are more durable.</p><p>Baby mats are soft mats with two cross-over &lsquo;rails&rsquo;; these rails often have loops where there will be dangling toys and/or accessories.</p><p>These are great for ferrets that generally love dangle toys such as cat wands. They often jump on top of the mat or lie on their backs and swat at the toys.</p><p>You can add an element of customisation to baby mats, too! By adding your own toys or changing the toys around.</p><p>When looking at baby mats, there are lots of options. You want to make sure you get a plain, soft mat. Not the ones that need batteries, have hard plastic accessories, or play awful scratchy lullabies.</p><p>Here are some linked examples:</p><p><a href=https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7293580 target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7293580>https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7293580</a></p><p><a href=https://amzn.eu/d/afkHYze target=_blank data-umami-event=outbound-link-clicked data-umami-event-url=https://amzn.eu/d/afkHYze>https://amzn.eu/d/afkHYze</a></p><p>Our ferret (Loot) playing with a palymat

There are many things that you may have lying around the house that you can use as a ferret toy! Such as:</p><ul><li>Cardboard boxes. All different shapes and sizes.</li><li>Packaging. As long as it is suitable. (Bubble wrap, for example, must be used with supervision).</li><li>Socks. Make a great stashing object.</li><li>Paper bags. Ferrets love climbing in them and the crinkle sounds they make.</li><li>Plastic bags. With supervision!</li><li>Ping pong balls.
And many, many more!</li></ul><p>I will be writing a blog post soon on some DIY ferret toy ideas using everyday objects!</p><hr><h2 id=unsafe-toys>Unsafe Toys!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unsafe-toys>#</a></h2><p>Lastly, I would like to discuss unsafe toys that you should avoid. I have touched on this within the categories, but to reiterate.
UNSAFE toys are:</p><ul><li>Rubber toys (blockage risk).</li><li>Silicone toys (blockage risk).</li><li>Vinyl toys (blockage risk).</li><li>Other soft plastic toys (blockage risk).</li><li>Toys with beans in (can be toxic and cause illness or blockage).</li><li>Scented toys (can cause respiratory upset).</li><li>Toys with hard plastic noses/eyes (can break off and cause choking/blockages).</li><li>Toys with feathers (can get stuck in their throats and cause blockage).</li><li>Toys with pompoms (blockage risk).</li><li>Rope toys (Can catch nails, toes or feet, can fray and be ingested, causing blockages, can get wrapped around teeth or cause irritation in the throat).</li></ul><hr><p>And that&rsquo;s it! My top ferret enrichment and toy ideas. I have included links to example items. I have tried to vary the links from supermarkets and general high street stores to pet shops, small businesses and online.</p><p>I hope this blog post has been helpful and inspired you to fill your ferret space with lots of enrichment and play opportunities.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://thatferret.blog/tags/enrichment/>Enrichment</a></li><li><a
