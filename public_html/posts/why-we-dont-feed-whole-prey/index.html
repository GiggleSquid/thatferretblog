I am highlighting specific reasons we choose not to whole feed.\nWhat is whole prey feeding? In short, whole prey feeding is where you feed whole prey to your ferrets — quite literally. It’s the entire carcass — including all the fluff!\nEach carcass would be considered a complete meal, containing all the meat, organs, and bones necessary to meet the ferrets’ nutritional requirements.\nWe opt to feed Prey Model Raw (also known as PMR) — a type of raw feeding based on the contents of whole prey feeding. But instead of feeding an entire carcass, you feed grinds or pieces to assemble what a whole prey would be — minus the fluff!\nYou can read more about whole prey feeding and prey model raw on our Raw 101 series.\nWhy whole prey is good There is a consensus that whole prey feeding is the most natural diet for domesticated ferrets, closely resembling what they may consume in the wild.\nWhole prey can be considered a better alternative (over other raw feeding methods). Here are four reasons why:\nIt gives enrichment to ferrets. Allowing them to rip into, dissect, and eat the carcass.\nIt allows ferrets to explore their natural behaviours and meat-eating abilities.\nIt keeps ferrets entertained for a more extended period. Instead of slurping soupies or eating grinds, ferrets must work for their food.\nIt’s convenient and easy to feed. It’s as simple as defrosting a carcass and giving it to your ferrets.\nOn top of this, many of the same benefits fit into other raw-feeding diets. Such as:\nNutritional Benefits. Dental Health Benefits. Better formed and less smelly poos. Shiny coats and healthy skin. Less risk of particular illnesses, etc. There are also some downsides to feeding whole prey, which swayed our decision. Some of these reasons are specific to us, and some are more widespread.\nReasons we don’t feed whole prey Remains and cleanup As with any raw food, you should clean up the remains if not eaten. Thblog post here!](/posts/basic-ferret-behaviours)is prevents the food from becoming rotten and posing a bacteria risk. If the ferrets do not eat the whole carcass (or even if there are remains), you will have to throw the carcass away after around a few hours. This food randomly disappearing can confuse ferrets.\nUnlike grinds or other raw feeding methods, where the ferrets do not associate the food with PREY, with whole feeding, ferrets know that a prey animal is present and they are consuming it.\nThis means that when you take the carcass away, they are more likely to realise it has been taken and replaced. Randomly taking away the carcass may result in an insecure attachment to food. Ferrets may wonder why you have taken it away, where it is gone, and become stressed by its removal.\nResource guarding The confusion of taking away the carcass could create a perceived food scarcity, leading ferrets to become more food-aggressive or develop the tendency to guard their food. This could result in behavioural issues such as biting or acting hostile when you take food remains away.\nFood possesion Bonded ferrets are often happy sharing a meal. However, with whole prey feeding, they may become more food-possessive over the carcass. It can lead to fighting or some ferrets being unable to get their share of food. (This would not count if you are pre-cutting up their whole prey — as they are likelier to share the pieces).\nFood stashing Some ferrets will stash their food. Stashing and dragging a carcass may be more unsettling to find than meat grinds (I know I wouldn’t want to see half of a random animal carcass). Cleaning up the remains of whole prey feeding is not for everyone.\nVariety Not being able to feed much variety. It depends highly on where you can obtain whole prey and the local availability. Some people may find whole prey more challenging to source than others.\nSelective eating Feeding whole prey may increase the likelihood of selective eating. Suppose you offer two ferrets a mouse carcass, for example. In that case, one ferret may eat all the muscle meat, and the other may prefer to eat all the organs; this differs from grinds, where everything is evenly distributed (mixed). Selective eating can lead to ferrets not eating a balanced diet, leading to multiple health issues.\nPublic facing We are part of a ferret society that attends multiple events and shows yearly. These shows are often public-facing, with children and families present. Feeding whole prey animals may be distressing to people who are not used to raw feeding. So, the ferret society has implemented a rule not to whole feed during these events. We would have to change the ferrets’ diet to grinds/other raw methods during these events. As ferrets imprint on their food, this may result in the ferrets not eating their food during outings.\nThis last point is particular to us but something to consider if you also take your ferrets out in public.\nTo conclude. There are many pros and cons to feeding Whole Prey. For us, the benefits don’t outweigh the cons enough to make it feasible.\nRaw feeding methods should suit specific owners and their personal preferences. Not all raw methods will suit everyone. Researching all the raw feeding methods is crucial to choose one that meets your and your ferrets’ needs.\n","wordCount":"936","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-03-17T07:59:05Z","dateModified":"2025-03-17T08:02:53Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bunny"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://thatferret.blog/posts/why-we-dont-feed-whole-prey/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"That Ferret Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://thatferret.blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id="
